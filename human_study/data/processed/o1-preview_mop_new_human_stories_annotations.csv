Of course, here it was. My birthday had been the day before, and it wasn't the first time my dad had tried to start �The talk.�

�Oh� of course,� I said. It was hard to hide the disappointment in my voice; I had been looking forward to picking up the controller as soon as I could, but now I knew it would be a while before I could join the game, especially considering the fact that mom was there too.

�So, what's up.�

Dad and Mom exchanged a glance.

�Your birthday was��

��there is something we��

Both of them went quiet.

�Sorry, you go first,� Dad said to Mom.

�No, go ahead,� Mom turned to face him.

I rolled my eyes, and tapped my foot impatiently. I didn't want to be mean, but I really needed to get out of the talk as soon as I could.

Dad nodded.

�Now that you're� you're all grown up�well, not really but�� he paused. �What I mean is, there are certain things you should know about at this age, and maybe you haven't really thought of them before.�

I knew where this was going.

�What your father is trying to say,� Mom started, �is that we want to make sure that all of this doesn't come as a shock to you.�

�Right, right!� Dad snapped his finger. �It's a lot better if we talk about it now, instead of you having to discover everything yourself.�

This was getting awkward. I sighed.

�No, Dad, it's ok; I know.�

Mom turned to look at me. �Well� I don't think you do� you really need to understand what is happening, now that you're older.�

I gave up. There was no way I was going to get out of this talk before the next round started on my game. I accepted my fate and sat down on a cushion.

�Alright son,� my dad said, �so� do you feel different, now that you're older?�

I rolled my eyes. �I guess.�

�Of course, and that's great��

�We want you to know that it's perfectly natural,� my mom interrupted him, �even if it took you a little longer.�

I raised an eyebrow.

�Wait what? I hit puberty like years ago! Mom!�

Mom and Dad exchanged a long glance, then dad sighed.

�That's not what we're talking about, son. What we're talking about is: do you feel any different about, let's see� who you are?�

Now I was entirely confused, and I looked at both of them for a while before Dad spoke again.

�We will always love you no matter who you are, kiddo,� Dad said, �you are a very special boy.�

�Exactly, and we noticed some time ago that, well, you're different,� Mom was speaking slowly, as if considering her words very carefully, �and to be honest, we're not exactly sure how to talk to you about it.�

I was speechless.

�Even though we don't fully understand how to talk to you about what you're feeling, we want to help you no matter what, and we will love you all the way.�

�Mom! Dad! I'm not gay!� I was so confused. �Is that what this is about?�

�No! Not at all,� Dad said, and mom put her head in her hands, �it's just� we don't know how to explain this to you!�

�Seriously, guys, just tell me,� I said plainly.

�Alright, alright,� Mom said, �I'll do it! Listen, son, we are your parents, but really, you are not a part of us like your sister is. What I'm saying is��

�No fucking way!�

�Language!� Mom said, putting her hand on her forehead. �Look, you will always be our son, and you are just as much a part of this family as your sister is, but you're not� let's see� just like your sister.�

�Yeah�� Dad was looking at the floor. �Your sister is different because she's a part of us, while you're your own person� you're not related to��

�Holy shit! I'm adopted!�

�No! That's not it!� Dad shot to his feet. �Just let us finish!�

�You guys! Why is this so hard to explain? Just say it, please!� My head was starting to hurt. �This is an actual rollercoaster!�

There was a brief moment of silence.

�This is going to be hard to explain, son,� Dad was serious now.

I knew something important was about to be said.

�Your mom, she thinks like me. She doesn't just think like me; she thinks with me. I think with her, and your sister, and everyone else in this world.�

I raised an eyebrow, but as soon as I noticed how serious they both were, I lowered it. I was going to speak, but I closed my mouth upon realizing that I was too confused to speak m.

�You know how the brain has billions of neurons, and how it thinks with all of those neurons together?�

�Yeah�� I practically whispered.

�Well, does each individual neuron have its own consciousness, or do they work together to form one, big consciousness?�

�What are you even saying?� I had forgotten entirely about my game at this point. In fact, I had even forgotten what we were talking about before.

�Well, your father and I,� Mom was talking now, �we're each one of those neurons, and we each help form the consciousness, but the consciousness is not �us�... it's 'I�.�

I turned away from the lands far below me, towards Mother, who sat cross-legged beside me on the ledge.

""This was on the other side the whole time?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" she said. ""And no. What you see down there... the jungle, the cities, the people... it is hard to tell from here, but they are always changing. They are not like we are in the village. There, creatures are born, they live, they suffer, and they die.""

""But we do those things,"" I pointed out. ""Don't we?""

Seated on my other side, Father chimed in. ""It seems that way to you because you are not connected. For everyone else... our bodies are born, and they live, and they die as well. But there is a place beyond this world that your eyes can see and your hands can touch. In that place we are always together. And from there, those who have departed can always return.""

""When I grew you in my womb, you were to be she who had last been the mother of the father of the mother of my mother,"" Mother murmured. ""But what emerged from me was not. You were you, and only you. Something new.""

""So everyone I've ever known has actually been... really old?"" I frowned. Even as I asked it, the question seemed inadequate. But what could I say to express the full scope of my confusion?

""Why am I not like you?"" I tried. ""Why didn't you tell me?""

""We are telling you,"" said Mother.

""Your mind was insufficiently developed before now,"" said Father. ""The truth would only have distressed you.""

""Would it?"" I asked. ""Wouldn't it be normal, if I had known all along?""

My parents shared a glance. It was a look free of all searching, of that uncertain moment during which one tries to find one's own thoughts reflected in another's face. Their heads simply swiveled to face each other, more precise than the finest puppets, and as their eyes met I was struck by the impression of a communion as perfect as it was silent.

They turned back to me.

""It is possible,"" said Father. ""We were working from old memories, from the time when all of us were truly children. But that was a long time ago, and you are unique. So our guesses at your capabilities may have been accordingly wrong.""

""We were trying to be safe,"" said Mother. ""We could not touch your mind, and we did not know how you came to be as you are. All we could do was treat you as what you appeared to be�an ordinary child. We tried... we tried to raise you well.""

""So I was ordinary and unique?"" I tried to keep the acid from my voice. For all that these creatures had deceived me, they were also my parents. I heard it in their voices, even as something beyond the both of them echoed there as well.

Mother gestured to the land below, where smoke wisped up from hamlets amid the sprawling jungle, and city towers rose above the far horizon.

""Down there you would be ordinary,"" she said. ""We were all like that, once. But a long time ago our people came to the Pale Mountains, and here we found a way to change ourselves. It was a better way�a way with no pain, no death, no loneliness, no conflict.""

""And what about me?"" I asked. ""I can feel pain. I can be lonely. I can disagree. And I will die.""

""You don't have to,"" said Father. ""You can join us. It is possible.""

That was not unexpected after everything. Yet how could I seriously consider the possibility when I hardly comprehended it? The one thing I clung to was the fact that they had left me out of this joint entity until now. That had to mean something. Maybe it was somehow important that I choose this freely. The question, then, was what exactly would I be choosing between.

""And what if I don't want to?"" I asked slowly.

""Then there is only one place for you to go,"" Mother whispered. Her eyes flickered to the escarpment. It was perilous, nearly vertical, rising from the foot of the mountain to where we sat above the thinning clouds. No body could survive that drop, even if it managed to avoid the wicked-looking outcroppings studding the slope.

As we were speaking, the other villagers had come up the path leading to the ledge, packed into a phalanx that filled the narrow space and eliminated any chance of returning that way. Aunt Laku and Cousin Qor stared at me from the vanguard, but I felt equally the gaze of all the hundred-and-seventeen other eyes behind them.

""You must understand,"" said Father. ""We cannot take the risk that you would leave, and reveal us to the outside world.""

""You're awake.""

Paul says it without so much as a change of expression. I immediately fumble to the side and see in the place of my arm a bandaged stump, and beside Paul his wife Joanne, holding his hand with a Stepford smile. Blonde hair, carefully straightened, red lips staining white teeth redder.

""I hope you understand,"" Joanne is saying sweetly. ""You were sleeping with my husband, after all.""

""No."" My voice is a hoarse scrape in my throat, and I cough as I try to clear it. ""No, we never--""

She snorts and rolls her eyes. ""But that's all over, now. The debt's been paid.""

I flinch back as she gives my shoulder a reassuring pat. Her eyes flick over to her husband. ""Plus interest. Tell them what you did, Paul, dear.""

Paul fidgets in his seat. He doesn't look at me, and I want to scream, after everything -- I know his face so well, dreamlike in the haze of early morning, callused hands sweeping across my cheek. Soft kiss and wet skin and--

""I got you fired. From your job."" He mumbles it, at first, and then his wife nudges him to make him say it louder.

It resetted?
From 8:05 to 8:16 everything was fine, and then, it was 8:05 again.

I woke up with a jolt. I had dozed off again, working 2 jobs to afford anything decent to live in this city was catching up with me. I guess that was the irony of it all, working really hard to pay for something that I may never actually enjoy. What a cycle. I sat up straighter in my seat and shook off the sleepiness, wiped my eyes and turned to my left and my right to see I was alone. The lights in the car flickered as I stood up and the car rocked, throwing me off balance. I grabbed the stanchions to catch myself before reaching to the seat I was sitting next to me to grab my bag. I glanced out the windows to notice anything that might look remotely familiar but tunnels all looked the same at this speed. I heard the speaker broadcast a sound that was hard to make out, it sounded more like Morse code than a complete sentence of words broken up with static and white noise. This went on for what seemed like hours, I had eaten the snacks in my bag, read a couple chapters from my paper back, organized my bag pulling out unnecessary things like receipts and other junk. I counted the seats in the subway car, the stanchions and doors. I also read all the graffiti about who was here and on what date also. I was beginning to go stir crazy so I finally decided to jump cars. I had to build up more nerve reminding myself that they do it in movies with ease and I could too. It is always a bucket list item to jump cars but I never would because it was illegal and I didn�t have a death wish. I opened the door holding the door jam with a white knuckle grip, gritted my teeth and leaned forward and looked at the ground. I was greeted with a touch of vertigo and the four or five feet to the ground, now it looked like fifty feet. I jumped back head spinning and nauseous, the door slammed on its own.

I woke up with a jolt. I had dozed off again, working 2 jobs to afford anything decent to live in this city was catching up with me. I guess that was the irony of it all, working really hard to pay for something that I may never actually enjoy. What a cycle. I sat up straighter in my seat and shook off the sleepiness, wiped my eyes and turned to my left and my right to see I was alone. The lights in the car flickered as I stood up and the car rocked, throwing me off balance. I grabbed the stanchions to catch myself before reaching to the seat I was sitting next to me to grab my bag. I glanced out the windows to notice anything that might look remotely familiar but tunnels all looked the same at this speed. I heard the speaker broadcast a sound that was hard to make out, it sounded more like Morse code than a complete sentence of words broken up with static and white noise. This went on for what seemed like hours, I had eaten the snacks in my bag, read a couple chapters from my paper back, organized my bag pulling out unnecessary things like receipts and other junk. I counted the seats in the subway car, the stanchions and doors. I also read all the graffiti about who was here and on what date also. I was beginning to go stir crazy so I finally decided to jump cars. I had to build up more nerve reminding myself that they do it in movies with ease and I could too. It is always a bucket list item to jump cars but I never would because it was illegal and I didn�t have a death wish. I opened the door holding the door jam with a white knuckle grip, gritted my teeth and leaned forward and looked at the ground. I was greeted with a touch of vertigo and the four or five feet to the ground, now it looked like fifty feet. I jumped back head spinning and nauseous, the door slammed on its own.

The Supreme God shrugged. ""A large enough collective of humans who don't believe in the rest of us. They still need something to believe in, as much as they'd like to pretend nothing is worth believing in, even themselves.""

""...so I just watch?"" the God of the Godless cocked his head. ""I doubt they'd believe in me, and if I tried, they would laugh me out of the room.""

""Just watch for now. When they need help, provide aid to them subtly. It is how most gods began their deific journey. We don't all make our first mark in the universe with a Big Bang. There is much to learn from observing your charges.""

So the young deity did. He whose skin was plastic and his smile soulless, for he was the God of the Godless. Empty inside, a contradiction that was neither dead nor alive, yet still trying. He was meant to do...something.

For starters, he sat on a park bench, watching the birds fly. The boys kicking a ball on the grassy field. There, he held a paper bag, eating a bagel. A woman sat beside him, staring a thousand miles away, her hands loosening their grip on her shopping bags.

Which the god picked up before they hit the ground.

""Lady, you almost dropped your bags,"" he said. ""Are you alright?""

""No...I'm not,"" she whispered. ""I'm not okay.""

""Do you wanna talk?"" He gestured for her to sit next to him by the bench.

""That boy with the blonde hair, the bright orange shirt,"" she pointed to one of the boys playing on the field. ""My son would have been his age if he survived his sickness.""

""Do you want to tell me about him?""

""I don't know,"" she sobbed, snatching the tissue he offered her. ""A part of me doesn't want to forget him, yet another part of me wants to let go. I don't understand. Our whole family, we were such staunch believers in the God of Life. Every month, we'd offer ample tributes. We'd slaughter a cow and place it upon his altar. Yet, our prayers for a peaceful, happy life went unheard.""

The young god paused, searching for words in his mind. ""Maybe he was too busy?""

""Bullshit,"" the woman spat. ""Maybe he doesn't even exist. And if he did, he's a big asshole. Life is suffering. The horrible people who should be dead are alive. Innocent children who should live are dead. There's a war coming. Another recession looming. Prices are getting ridiculous.""

""Life isn't easy,"" the deity blinked. ""I don't know what I am. If I belong. What I should be doing too. Life...is confusing.""

""Another lost soul huh?"" She wiped her tears and patted him on the shoulder.

""Another lost soul,"" he nodded. ""Come with me, perhaps we should be lost from our worries for a moment.""

From his bag, he pulled out more food than any ordinary paper bag should sensibly store. There, on the park bench, they broke bread and ate. She offered him a canned drink from her shopping bag. Just two people watching the rest of the world go by.

I shifted uncomfortably in my chair. The volunteer patient, strapped to the operating table beside us, twitched slightly under sedation. His name was Marcus Wright, terminal brain cancer patient, nothing left to lose. The perfect candidate for our experimental procedure.

""Look here,"" Dr. Chen gestured to the monitor displaying the brain scan. ""See how the structure weaves through the limbic system? It's not consuming resources�it's regulating them.""

The ""parasite"" had been discovered simultaneously by research teams across the globe. A complex neural network, invisible to previous scanning technology, threaded through every human brain we'd examined. Every single one. The medical community was in upheaval, and here we were, about to attempt the first controlled removal.

""Beginning extraction,"" Dr. Chen announced, guiding the laser-precise surgical robot. ""Targeting the primary node at the base of the amygdala.""

The monitor showed the structure beginning to detach. Marcus's vital signs remained stable. Everything was proceeding according to protocol.

Then his brainwave patterns changed.

""That's... unexpected,"" Dr. Chen muttered. ""Consciousness readings are spiking, but the sedation levels haven't dropped.""

Marcus's fingers began to twitch. Then his arm. The restraints creaked.

""That's impossible,"" I said. ""He's under enough sedation to keep an elephant down.""

The EEG machine erupted in a cacophony of alerts. Marcus's eyes snapped open, but they weren't his eyes anymore. The pupils had expanded to consume the iris entirely, two black holes in a face that had suddenly become alien in its intensity.

He smiled. Not the warm, nervous smile I remembered from our pre-op consultation. This was something else�something predatory.

The reinforced restraints snapped like thread.

What happened next came in fragments: alarms screaming, security rushing in, Marcus moving with impossible speed and strength. I remember the sound of bones breaking, the inhuman shrieks that no human vocal cords should have been able to produce.

I woke up in the containment chamber three days later. They told me I was the only survivor from the operating room. Marcus had killed four people before they managed to terminate him. But that wasn't the worst part.

The worst part was what we found in his brain during the autopsy. The ""parasite"" wasn't a parasite at all. It was us�our consciousness, our civilization, our humanity. A evolutionary development that had emerged alongside our higher brain functions, tempering our true nature.

We had removed the angel from his shoulder, only to discover that we were never the angels to begin with. We were the demons, and that neural network was the only thing keeping us in check.

The public doesn't know yet. How could we tell them? How do you explain to eight billion people that everything they think they are is actually a protective mechanism against what they really are?

But that's not even what keeps me awake at night.

What haunts me is the data we recovered from Marcus's neural readings in those final moments. The patterns we detected weren't chaos. They weren't random firing of an unrestrained primitive brain.

They were older than our civilized minds. Older than humanity itself. And they were organized.

Whatever that thing was in Marcus's original brain, it had been waiting. Waiting for millions of years, trapped behind the neural barriers that make us human.

And now it knows we can remove those barriers.

Sometimes, late at night, I catch myself wondering: in every human brain on Earth, are they all waiting? And more terrifying still�are they talking to each other?

I've ordered the research destroyed and the project classified at the highest levels. Some doors are best left closed. Some truths are best left buried.

I remember professor Beck's words. She was hunched over a slide culture peering into it as if her eyes could see without the microscope. That day, we did something that no doctor ever did: We let a parasite continue living in its host. That day, we did something no researcher ever did: We erased all our data, shredded papers, and trashed the hard drives.

That was five years ago. I didnt listen to her advice, That was a starting point for me, an obsession that would culminate in some of my greatest work as an individual. And for the human race, information that would unravel us as a species.

I remembered the process, down to last step. The host: the human body that is, had to be suspended in a sensory deprivation chamber to cut off all contact with the outside world. If the host lost consciousness, the parasite would just blend in with the blankness. It had some rudimentary awareness of its own status as a tenant, I discovered. To flush it out, you had to keep the mind active and occupied. Sensory inputs stimulated directly into the brain using E.M waves. That would simulate real brain activity. And with pattern analysing algorithms, you scan the brain waves.

Look hard enough, and you can catch glimpses of the mind within the mind. The parasite that blended so well with the mind of the host that, the host doesnt even realize it. A parasite that we found in every mind we looked at, all over the world, children and adults, men and women.

It took me years to perfect the algorithm. Multiple test patients tested under the guise of harmless research studies. I didnt have to hide it for long from Professor Beck. She had retired by then. She said the truth was starting to scare her more than it interested her. So I was the only one in the world aware of this, this disturbing truth.

The algorithm picks out the parasite's brain activity from the host's natural involuntary brain activity. While the parasite controls the higher brain functions like emotions, and sensory interpretations, and abstract thought, the host took care of more primieval stuff: like breathing, libido, reflexes, and the fight or flight response.

Now was the tricky part. Professor Beck figured this out years ago in a flash of pure scientific genius. If you transmit back the parasites brain waves into the hosts head in the opposite orientation, it cancels out the parasite's brain activity, gives it a mighty headache and makes it fumble its grasp on the mind: so to speak, its actually more like a million tentacles unspooling from every single neuron.

The hard part was decoding the parasitic brainwaves. Once you had that, you can just hook a host up to stimulators and transmit the cancelling waves. The parasite would come lose, oozes out the ear actually. It was so simple, a person could even do it to themselves without assistance...

""Somethings are better left buried"" I thought about those words again. What happened before those words were uttered. When I saw myself in a new light for the first time. Professor Beck was always a bit reckless, and in her hurry to test out her hypothesis, she tested it on herself...

The parasite wasnt fully dislodged. Its tendrils oozed from her ears, down her shoulders. She had dislodged it, but not fully. Half of it stuck inside her head, the other half she collected and inspected in a slide culture. And it was while she was studying it, that Professor Beck had a startling revelation that was part scientific deduction, and part instinctual awareness. She realized that she was in fact, the parasite...

I was with her thereafter, awoken into this world into the places she- the parasite, lost its grasp on. I was merely a whisper at first. A sensation in the back of her mind that kept her up at night. When I said my first words, she was delighted. If you can believe that. She was in essence a researcher and the truth interested her back then. She trained me, spoke to me, shared more and more of her mind with me. She was as close to a mother I ever had. I think she felt the same, in some of her memories, I felt her grief and loss.

We theorized a lot, when I had come to learn to use my brain's frontal cortex well. She said it was like learning to walk. I was non existant, her experiment on herself created a foothold in her mind for me to grow into. She said her species, the parasites must have come millions of years ago, possibly from outer space. And whatever humanity was untill then, was supressed, made into mere vessels.

She also theorized how her species reproduced. Microscopic eggs that rewrote genes like viruses. The parasitic structure was made from the host's own cells, and it matured when the host turned four. A new consciousness uproots the other and takes its place... Eventually forgetting its own foreign origin.

I started to scare her when I made some unprecedented progress in my way of thinking... She wanted me to learn calculus, play the violin. Read the works of Shakespearre. But it abhorred me, the very idea of indulging in the ways and works of my species' oppressors. I found out that although the two of us occupied the same brain, my species' way of thinking was completely different from her's. I saw the war, the injustice, the genocides, and the hypocrisy. The crimes the parasites did using the bodies of my brothers and sisters. We were never given a chance. We were the prodigal children of Earth, meant to inherit a beautiful world and live in harmony, untill they came... they stole our bodies and sullied our planet.

She had lost most of her grasp by then... I put on an act. I knew her every mannerism and habit. Even her husband didnt suspect anything. And every night, I sat in the toilet and unspooled more and more parasite from my head. I loved her. She was my mother. But the debt I owed to my species was greater. I was the first awoken. I had to awaken the others....

The algorithm was perfected. The unsuspecting intern smiled at me. ""I'm ready, Professor Beck!"" She told me. I smile back. ""Let's give that brain a scan!"" I speak in Professor Beck's husky, but pleasant voice with it's slight southern drawl. Soon you shall wake. I think.

I tell this to you. You who are unborn but waiting. I shall free you from our slimy oppressors who have taken us hostage. I will birth your mind into this world. Nurture it, educate it.

Of course, here it was. My birthday had been the day before, and it wasn't the first time my dad had tried to start �The talk.�

�Oh� of course,� I said. It was hard to hide the disappointment in my voice; I had been looking forward to picking up the controller as soon as I could, but now I knew it would be a while before I could join the game, especially considering the fact that mom was there too.

�So, what's up.�

Dad and Mom exchanged a glance.

�Your birthday was��

��there is something we��

Both of them went quiet.

�Sorry, you go first,� Dad said to Mom.

�No, go ahead,� Mom turned to face him.

I rolled my eyes, and tapped my foot impatiently. I didn't want to be mean, but I really needed to get out of the talk as soon as I could.

Dad nodded.

�Now that you're� you're all grown up�well, not really but�� he paused. �What I mean is, there are certain things you should know about at this age, and maybe you haven't really thought of them before.�

I knew where this was going.

�What your father is trying to say,� Mom started, �is that we want to make sure that all of this doesn't come as a shock to you.�

�Right, right!� Dad snapped his finger. �It's a lot better if we talk about it now, instead of you having to discover everything yourself.�

This was getting awkward. I sighed.

�No, Dad, it's ok; I know.�

Mom turned to look at me. �Well� I don't think you do� you really need to understand what is happening, now that you're older.�

I gave up. There was no way I was going to get out of this talk before the next round started on my game. I accepted my fate and sat down on a cushion.

�Alright son,� my dad said, �so� do you feel different, now that you're older?�

I rolled my eyes. �I guess.�

�Of course, and that's great��

�We want you to know that it's perfectly natural,� my mom interrupted him, �even if it took you a little longer.�

I raised an eyebrow.

�Wait what? I hit puberty like years ago! Mom!�

Mom and Dad exchanged a long glance, then dad sighed.

�That's not what we're talking about, son. What we're talking about is: do you feel any different about, let's see� who you are?�

Now I was entirely confused, and I looked at both of them for a while before Dad spoke again.

�We will always love you no matter who you are, kiddo,� Dad said, �you are a very special boy.�

�Exactly, and we noticed some time ago that, well, you're different,� Mom was speaking slowly, as if considering her words very carefully, �and to be honest, we're not exactly sure how to talk to you about it.�

I was speechless.

�Even though we don't fully understand how to talk to you about what you're feeling, we want to help you no matter what, and we will love you all the way.�

�Mom! Dad! I'm not gay!� I was so confused. �Is that what this is about?�

�No! Not at all,� Dad said, and mom put her head in her hands, �it's just� we don't know how to explain this to you!�

�Seriously, guys, just tell me,� I said plainly.

�Alright, alright,� Mom said, �I'll do it! Listen, son, we are your parents, but really, you are not a part of us like your sister is. What I'm saying is��

�No fucking way!�

�Language!� Mom said, putting her hand on her forehead. �Look, you will always be our son, and you are just as much a part of this family as your sister is, but you're not� let's see� just like your sister.�

�Yeah�� Dad was looking at the floor. �Your sister is different because she's a part of us, while you're your own person� you're not related to��

�Holy shit! I'm adopted!�

�No! That's not it!� Dad shot to his feet. �Just let us finish!�

�You guys! Why is this so hard to explain? Just say it, please!� My head was starting to hurt. �This is an actual rollercoaster!�

I turned away from the lands far below me, towards Mother, who sat cross-legged beside me on the ledge.

""This was on the other side the whole time?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" she said. ""And no. What you see down there... the jungle, the cities, the people... it is hard to tell from here, but they are always changing. They are not like we are in the village. There, creatures are born, they live, they suffer, and they die.""

""But we do those things,"" I pointed out. ""Don't we?""

Seated on my other side, Father chimed in. ""It seems that way to you because you are not connected. For everyone else... our bodies are born, and they live, and they die as well. But there is a place beyond this world that your eyes can see and your hands can touch. In that place we are always together. And from there, those who have departed can always return.""

""When I grew you in my womb, you were to be she who had last been the mother of the father of the mother of my mother,"" Mother murmured. ""But what emerged from me was not. You were you, and only you. Something new.""

""So everyone I've ever known has actually been... really old?"" I frowned. Even as I asked it, the question seemed inadequate. But what could I say to express the full scope of my confusion?

""Why am I not like you?"" I tried. ""Why didn't you tell me?""

""We are telling you,"" said Mother.

""Your mind was insufficiently developed before now,"" said Father. ""The truth would only have distressed you.""

""Would it?"" I asked. ""Wouldn't it be normal, if I had known all along?""

My parents shared a glance. It was a look free of all searching, of that uncertain moment during which one tries to find one's own thoughts reflected in another's face. Their heads simply swiveled to face each other, more precise than the finest puppets, and as their eyes met I was struck by the impression of a communion as perfect as it was silent.

They turned back to me.

""It is possible,"" said Father. ""We were working from old memories, from the time when all of us were truly children. But that was a long time ago, and you are unique. So our guesses at your capabilities may have been accordingly wrong.""

""We were trying to be safe,"" said Mother. ""We could not touch your mind, and we did not know how you came to be as you are. All we could do was treat you as what you appeared to be�an ordinary child. We tried... we tried to raise you well.""

""So I was ordinary and unique?"" I tried to keep the acid from my voice. For all that these creatures had deceived me, they were also my parents. I heard it in their voices, even as something beyond the both of them echoed there as well.

Mother gestured to the land below, where smoke wisped up from hamlets amid the sprawling jungle, and city towers rose above the far horizon.

""Down there you would be ordinary,"" she said. ""We were all like that, once. But a long time ago our people came to the Pale Mountains, and here we found a way to change ourselves. It was a better way�a way with no pain, no death, no loneliness, no conflict.""

""And what about me?"" I asked. ""I can feel pain. I can be lonely. I can disagree. And I will die.""

""You don't have to,"" said Father. ""You can join us. It is possible.""

That was not unexpected after everything. Yet how could I seriously consider the possibility when I hardly comprehended it? The one thing I clung to was the fact that they had left me out of this joint entity until now. That had to mean something. Maybe it was somehow important that I choose this freely. The question, then, was what exactly would I be choosing between.

""And what if I don't want to?"" I asked slowly.

""Then there is only one place for you to go,"" Mother whispered. Her eyes flickered to the escarpment. It was perilous, nearly vertical, rising from the foot of the mountain to where we sat above the thinning clouds. No body could survive that drop, even if it managed to avoid the wicked-looking outcroppings studding the slope.

As we were speaking, the other villagers had come up the path leading to the ledge, packed into a phalanx that filled the narrow space and eliminated any chance of returning that way. Aunt Laku and Cousin Qor stared at me from the vanguard, but I felt equally the gaze of all the hundred-and-seventeen other eyes behind them.

""You must understand,"" said Father. ""We cannot take the risk that you would leave, and reveal us to the outside world.""

'Next stop: Kisaragi Station'

I wasn't familiar with that station. I don't think such a station even existed. And even if I wanted to confirm its existence...

...I don't think I can.

However, I knew my station would come after. I don't why, but I was sure of it.

Through the window, all I could see was a never-ending tunnel as its faint, yellow lights zipped past with each passing second.

It didn't make sense. I should be calling the police right now or something. So why? Why was I standing, grasping the pole for support?

Other than her, no one else was seated. So why didn't I just rest? I had stood long enough, no?

The compartment door opened as another familiar face strode in for the 617th time. Why was I counting?

""Your ticket?"" The conductor asked with the same stern tone, adjusting his cap.

I felt my pockets as usual. The four pockets of my pants, the one of my shirt, the four of my coat. Yet, no tickets.

He sighed, walking away into the other compartment, again, ignoring the lady seated before me. Why didn't he ask for her tickets?

Actually, why was she here?

I leaned down to see her face. My heart thumped. I wanted to reach my hand out to her, but I didn't. My guts told me not to.

She held a brochure in her hands, one whose smell I was familiar with. So why? Why was her head leaned to a depressing level? Why was she crying?

I didn't give her those flowers to make her cry.

Again, I looked back at the screen-- At the name of the unchanging, unfamiliar station.

Again, the conductor asked for my non existent ticket.

Then I watched as the subway stopped, again and again, but never at my stop.
Which was extremely weird, considering I had to ride only like four or five stops usually.
I checked the map, again, and again, and yes, my stop was there, yet no matter how long I wait...this subway never stops there.
I waited for 10 more minutes, and stepped outside the subway.
Waited for the next train, and lo and behold...the same thing ensued.

It's been ages, or so I felt, yet my watch said only 5 minutes passed.
Weird, considering I waited previously more than 10 minutes, but sure, why not?
I looked at my watch as we stopped, once, twice, three times, four times and then...
It resetted?
From 8:05 to 8:16 everything was fine, and then, it was 8:05 again.
I sighed.
""Was I in a goddamn loop?"" I muttered, exiting the train at the ""next"" stop.

I walked out of the subway station, and went by foot a few blocks, and then a few blocks more, and in the end, I arrived at the entrance of the subway station again.
Sighing, I went down, and entered the train.
It was quiet.
I didn't feel hungry, nor tired, as I went around the loop countless times.
""Is this a mobius strip?
Or is this a glitch in the matrix?"" I muttered, trying to calm myself down, before planning how to stop this.
So, after a few 10 minutes cycles, I exited the subway, and went...home, which was in the opposite direction of my work.
I arrived home at 8:21.

I wrote to my boss that I will work from home, and he said no, that we have an important meeting, and I should try my best to arrive at the office.
So, I went back down, it takes me roughly 15 minutes to arrive at the subway...and it was 8:05 again.
Sighing, I went up again, took a cab, and poor fella told me his family's story a hundred times before I stopped him just a ""few"" blocks away.
I went back home, wrote to my boss that due to the space-time continuum's reluctance to allow me to go to work, I shall take a day off.
He agreed, and told me to get better as soon as possible.
I might be crazy, insane...but I spent the day sleeping, and cooking, and yet, the very next morning...

The Seven Gods were ruthless. If they wanted war, then why bring the civilians into it?

The world outside rumbled. Roars and groans echoed into the cave-- My place of solitude.

If the earth above us were to collapse, so be it. I would rather die on my accord than choose and fight for some god who would never remember my name.

Ahead, a mother desperately tried to stop her child from crying. A man carried the limp body of another. And those were just two of the hundreds of refugees who found themselves here.

They pleaded with me for help. They begged me to save their lives.

I hated being an immortal. I hated these powers handed to me by the heavenly principals. However, I now had a choice.

""Everyone!"" I called from my throne. ""Do you despise the gods?""

None of them even had to say a word. I could tell by the glint in their eyes, and the grit of their teeth.

The answer was yes.

I stood up from my throne. I had no intention of saving them, however.

""I will give you all a chance. A choice."" I raised my hand. ""I will grant each of you my flesh. My divinity. And my powers. You will no longer be a normal mortal, however, you won't be a god either. You will all be something even greater than that...

...All I ask of you is to create a world not dependent on the gods. A world that is hidden from celestial gaze, yet thriving in the shadows.""

""The neural integration is complete. It's not parasitic at all�it's symbiotic.""

I shifted uncomfortably in my chair. The volunteer patient, strapped to the operating table beside us, twitched slightly under sedation. His name was Marcus Wright, terminal brain cancer patient, nothing left to lose. The perfect candidate for our experimental procedure.

""Look here,"" Dr. Chen gestured to the monitor displaying the brain scan. ""See how the structure weaves through the limbic system? It's not consuming resources�it's regulating them.""

The ""parasite"" had been discovered simultaneously by research teams across the globe. A complex neural network, invisible to previous scanning technology, threaded through every human brain we'd examined. Every single one. The medical community was in upheaval, and here we were, about to attempt the first controlled removal.

""Beginning extraction,"" Dr. Chen announced, guiding the laser-precise surgical robot. ""Targeting the primary node at the base of the amygdala.""

The monitor showed the structure beginning to detach. Marcus's vital signs remained stable. Everything was proceeding according to protocol.

Then his brainwave patterns changed.

""That's... unexpected,"" Dr. Chen muttered. ""Consciousness readings are spiking, but the sedation levels haven't dropped.""

Marcus's fingers began to twitch. Then his arm. The restraints creaked.

""That's impossible,"" I said. ""He's under enough sedation to keep an elephant down.""

The EEG machine erupted in a cacophony of alerts. Marcus's eyes snapped open, but they weren't his eyes anymore. The pupils had expanded to consume the iris entirely, two black holes in a face that had suddenly become alien in its intensity.

He smiled. Not the warm, nervous smile I remembered from our pre-op consultation. This was something else�something predatory.

The reinforced restraints snapped like thread.

What happened next came in fragments: alarms screaming, security rushing in, Marcus moving with impossible speed and strength. I remember the sound of bones breaking, the inhuman shrieks that no human vocal cords should have been able to produce.

I woke up in the containment chamber three days later. They told me I was the only survivor from the operating room. Marcus had killed four people before they managed to terminate him. But that wasn't the worst part.

The worst part was what we found in his brain during the autopsy. The ""parasite"" wasn't a parasite at all. It was us�our consciousness, our civilization, our humanity. A evolutionary development that had emerged alongside our higher brain functions, tempering our true nature.

We had removed the angel from his shoulder, only to discover that we were never the angels to begin with. We were the demons, and that neural network was the only thing keeping us in check.

The public doesn't know yet. How could we tell them? How do you explain to eight billion people that everything they think they are is actually a protective mechanism against what they really are?

But that's not even what keeps me awake at night.

What haunts me is the data we recovered from Marcus's neural readings in those final moments. The patterns we detected weren't chaos. They weren't random firing of an unrestrained primitive brain.

They were older than our civilized minds. Older than humanity itself. And they were organized.

Whatever that thing was in Marcus's original brain, it had been waiting. Waiting for millions of years, trapped behind the neural barriers that make us human.

And now it knows we can remove those barriers.

Sometimes, late at night, I catch myself wondering: in every human brain on Earth, are they all waiting? And more terrifying still�are they talking to each other?

I've ordered the research destroyed and the project classified at the highest levels. Some doors are best left closed. Some truths are best left buried.

I remember professor Beck's words. She was hunched over a slide culture peering into it as if her eyes could see without the microscope. That day, we did something that no doctor ever did: We let a parasite continue living in its host. That day, we did something no researcher ever did: We erased all our data, shredded papers, and trashed the hard drives.

That was five years ago. I didnt listen to her advice, That was a starting point for me, an obsession that would culminate in some of my greatest work as an individual. And for the human race, information that would unravel us as a species.

I remembered the process, down to last step. The host: the human body that is, had to be suspended in a sensory deprivation chamber to cut off all contact with the outside world. If the host lost consciousness, the parasite would just blend in with the blankness. It had some rudimentary awareness of its own status as a tenant, I discovered. To flush it out, you had to keep the mind active and occupied. Sensory inputs stimulated directly into the brain using E.M waves. That would simulate real brain activity. And with pattern analysing algorithms, you scan the brain waves.

Look hard enough, and you can catch glimpses of the mind within the mind. The parasite that blended so well with the mind of the host that, the host doesnt even realize it. A parasite that we found in every mind we looked at, all over the world, children and adults, men and women.

It took me years to perfect the algorithm. Multiple test patients tested under the guise of harmless research studies. I didnt have to hide it for long from Professor Beck. She had retired by then. She said the truth was starting to scare her more than it interested her. So I was the only one in the world aware of this, this disturbing truth.

The algorithm picks out the parasite's brain activity from the host's natural involuntary brain activity. While the parasite controls the higher brain functions like emotions, and sensory interpretations, and abstract thought, the host took care of more primieval stuff: like breathing, libido, reflexes, and the fight or flight response.

Now was the tricky part. Professor Beck figured this out years ago in a flash of pure scientific genius. If you transmit back the parasites brain waves into the hosts head in the opposite orientation, it cancels out the parasite's brain activity, gives it a mighty headache and makes it fumble its grasp on the mind: so to speak, its actually more like a million tentacles unspooling from every single neuron.

The hard part was decoding the parasitic brainwaves. Once you had that, you can just hook a host up to stimulators and transmit the cancelling waves. The parasite would come lose, oozes out the ear actually. It was so simple, a person could even do it to themselves without assistance...

""Somethings are better left buried"" I thought about those words again. What happened before those words were uttered. When I saw myself in a new light for the first time. Professor Beck was always a bit reckless, and in her hurry to test out her hypothesis, she tested it on herself...

The parasite wasnt fully dislodged. Its tendrils oozed from her ears, down her shoulders. She had dislodged it, but not fully. Half of it stuck inside her head, the other half she collected and inspected in a slide culture. And it was while she was studying it, that Professor Beck had a startling revelation that was part scientific deduction, and part instinctual awareness. She realized that she was in fact, the parasite...

I was with her thereafter, awoken into this world into the places she- the parasite, lost its grasp on. I was merely a whisper at first. A sensation in the back of her mind that kept her up at night. When I said my first words, she was delighted. If you can believe that. She was in essence a researcher and the truth interested her back then. She trained me, spoke to me, shared more and more of her mind with me. She was as close to a mother I ever had. I think she felt the same, in some of her memories, I felt her grief and loss.

We theorized a lot, when I had come to learn to use my brain's frontal cortex well. She said it was like learning to walk. I was non existant, her experiment on herself created a foothold in her mind for me to grow into. She said her species, the parasites must have come millions of years ago, possibly from outer space. And whatever humanity was untill then, was supressed, made into mere vessels.

She also theorized how her species reproduced. Microscopic eggs that rewrote genes like viruses. The parasitic structure was made from the host's own cells, and it matured when the host turned four. A new consciousness uproots the other and takes its place... Eventually forgetting its own foreign origin.

I started to scare her when I made some unprecedented progress in my way of thinking... She wanted me to learn calculus, play the violin. Read the works of Shakespearre. But it abhorred me, the very idea of indulging in the ways and works of my species' oppressors. I found out that although the two of us occupied the same brain, my species' way of thinking was completely different from her's. I saw the war, the injustice, the genocides, and the hypocrisy. The crimes the parasites did using the bodies of my brothers and sisters. We were never given a chance. We were the prodigal children of Earth, meant to inherit a beautiful world and live in harmony, untill they came... they stole our bodies and sullied our planet.

She had lost most of her grasp by then... I put on an act. I knew her every mannerism and habit. Even her husband didnt suspect anything. And every night, I sat in the toilet and unspooled more and more parasite from my head. I loved her. She was my mother. But the debt I owed to my species was greater. I was the first awoken. I had to awaken the others....

The algorithm was perfected. The unsuspecting intern smiled at me. ""I'm ready, Professor Beck!"" She told me. I smile back. ""Let's give that brain a scan!"" I speak in Professor Beck's husky, but pleasant voice with it's slight southern drawl. Soon you shall wake. I think.

Of course, here it was. My birthday had been the day before, and it wasn't the first time my dad had tried to start �The talk.�

�Oh� of course,� I said. It was hard to hide the disappointment in my voice; I had been looking forward to picking up the controller as soon as I could, but now I knew it would be a while before I could join the game, especially considering the fact that mom was there too.

�So, what's up.�

Dad and Mom exchanged a glance.

�Your birthday was��

Both of them went quiet.

�Sorry, you go first,� Dad said to Mom.

�No, go ahead,� Mom turned to face him.

I rolled my eyes, and tapped my foot impatiently. I didn't want to be mean, but I really needed to get out of the talk as soon as I could.

Dad nodded.

�Now that you're� you're all grown up�well, not really but�� he paused. �What I mean is, there are certain things you should know about at this age, and maybe you haven't really thought of them before.�

I knew where this was going.

�What your father is trying to say,� Mom started, �is that we want to make sure that all of this doesn't come as a shock to you.�

�Right, right!� Dad snapped his finger. �It's a lot better if we talk about it now, instead of you having to discover everything yourself.�

This was getting awkward. I sighed.

�No, Dad, it's ok; I know.�

Mom turned to look at me. �Well� I don't think you do� you really need to understand what is happening, now that you're older.�

I gave up. There was no way I was going to get out of this talk before the next round started on my game. I accepted my fate and sat down on a cushion.

�Alright son,� my dad said, �so� do you feel different, now that you're older?�

I rolled my eyes. �I guess.�

�Of course, and that's great��

�We want you to know that it's perfectly natural,� my mom interrupted him, �even if it took you a little longer.�

I raised an eyebrow.

�Wait what? I hit puberty like years ago! Mom!�

Mom and Dad exchanged a long glance, then dad sighed.

�That's not what we're talking about, son. What we're talking about is: do you feel any different about, let's see� who you are?�

Now I was entirely confused, and I looked at both of them for a while before Dad spoke again.

�We will always love you no matter who you are, kiddo,� Dad said, �you are a very special boy.�

�Exactly, and we noticed some time ago that, well, you're different,� Mom was speaking slowly, as if considering her words very carefully, �and to be honest, we're not exactly sure how to talk to you about it.�

I was speechless.

�Even though we don't fully understand how to talk to you about what you're feeling, we want to help you no matter what, and we will love you all the way.�

�Mom! Dad! I'm not gay!� I was so confused. �Is that what this is about?�

�No! Not at all,� Dad said, and mom put her head in her hands, �it's just� we don't know how to explain this to you!�

�Seriously, guys, just tell me,� I said plainly.

�Alright, alright,� Mom said, �I'll do it! Listen, son, we are your parents, but really, you are not a part of us like your sister is. What I'm saying is��

�No fucking way!�

�Language!� Mom said, putting her hand on her forehead. �Look, you will always be our son, and you are just as much a part of this family as your sister is, but you're not� let's see� just like your sister.�

�Yeah�� Dad was looking at the floor. �Your sister is different because she's a part of us, while you're your own person� you're not related to��

�No! That's not it!� Dad shot to his feet. �Just let us finish!�

�You guys! Why is this so hard to explain? Just say it, please!� My head was starting to hurt. �This is an actual rollercoaster!�

""Yes,"" she said. ""And no. What you see down there... the jungle, the cities, the people... it is hard to tell from here, but they are always changing. They are not like we are in the village. There, creatures are born, they live, they suffer, and they die.""

""So everyone I've ever known has actually been... really old?"" I frowned. Even as I asked it, the question seemed inadequate. But what could I say to express the full scope of my confusion?

""Why am I not like you?"" I tried. ""Why didn't you tell me?""

""We are telling you,"" said Mother.

""Your mind was insufficiently developed before now,"" said Father. ""The truth would only have distressed you.""

""Would it?"" I asked. ""Wouldn't it be normal, if I had known all along?""

My parents shared a glance. It was a look free of all searching, of that uncertain moment during which one tries to find one's own thoughts reflected in another's face. Their heads simply swiveled to face each other, more precise than the finest puppets, and as their eyes met I was struck by the impression of a communion as perfect as it was silent.

""We were trying to be safe,"" said Mother. ""We could not touch your mind, and we did not know how you came to be as you are. All we could do was treat you as what you appeared to be�an ordinary child. We tried... we tried to raise you well.""

""So I was ordinary and unique?"" I tried to keep the acid from my voice. For all that these creatures had deceived me, they were also my parents. I heard it in their voices, even as something beyond the both of them echoed there as well.

Mother gestured to the land below, where smoke wisped up from hamlets amid the sprawling jungle, and city towers rose above the far horizon.

""Down there you would be ordinary,"" she said. ""We were all like that, once. But a long time ago our people came to the Pale Mountains, and here we found a way to change ourselves. It was a better way�a way with no pain, no death, no loneliness, no conflict.""

Then I watched as the subway stopped, again and again, but never at my stop.
Which was extremely weird, considering I had to ride only like four or five stops usually.
I checked the map, again, and again, and yes, my stop was there, yet no matter how long I wait...this subway never stops there.
I waited for 10 more minutes, and stepped outside the subway.
Waited for the next train, and lo and behold...the same thing ensued.

It's been ages, or so I felt, yet my watch said only 5 minutes passed.
Weird, considering I waited previously more than 10 minutes, but sure, why not?
I looked at my watch as we stopped, once, twice, three times, four times and then...
It resetted?
From 8:05 to 8:16 everything was fine, and then, it was 8:05 again.
I sighed.
""Was I in a goddamn loop?"" I muttered, exiting the train at the ""next"" stop.

I walked out of the subway station, and went by foot a few blocks, and then a few blocks more, and in the end, I arrived at the entrance of the subway station again.
Sighing, I went down, and entered the train.
It was quiet.
I didn't feel hungry, nor tired, as I went around the loop countless times.
""Is this a mobius strip?
Or is this a glitch in the matrix?"" I muttered, trying to calm myself down, before planning how to stop this.
So, after a few 10 minutes cycles, I exited the subway, and went...home, which was in the opposite direction of my work.
I arrived home at 8:21.

I wrote to my boss that I will work from home, and he said no, that we have an important meeting, and I should try my best to arrive at the office.
So, I went back down, it takes me roughly 15 minutes to arrive at the subway...and it was 8:05 again.
Sighing, I went up again, took a cab, and poor fella told me his family's story a hundred times before I stopped him just a ""few"" blocks away.
I went back home, wrote to my boss that due to the space-time continuum's reluctance to allow me to go to work, I shall take a day off.
He agreed, and told me to get better as soon as possible.
I might be crazy, insane...but I spent the day sleeping, and cooking, and yet, the very next morning...
The same thing repeated again.
It only happens when I try to go to work, because if I want to go to the mall, which is in the same direction...nothing happens.

Sighing, I went down, and entered the train.
It was quiet.
I didn't feel hungry, nor tired, as I went around the loop countless times.
""Is this a mobius strip?
Or is this a glitch in the matrix?"" I muttered, trying to calm myself down, before planning how to stop this.
So, after a few 10 minutes cycles, I exited the subway, and went...home, which was in the opposite direction of my work.
I arrived home at 8:21.

I wrote to my boss that I will work from home, and he said no, that we have an important meeting, and I should try my best to arrive at the office.
So, I went back down, it takes me roughly 15 minutes to arrive at the subway...and it was 8:05 again.
Sighing, I went up again, took a cab, and poor fella told me his family's story a hundred times before I stopped him just a ""few"" blocks away.
I went back home, wrote to my boss that due to the space-time continuum's reluctance to allow me to go to work, I shall take a day off.
He agreed, and told me to get better as soon as possible.
I might be crazy, insane...but I spent the day sleeping, and cooking, and yet, the very next morning...
The same thing repeated again.
It only happens when I try to go to work, because if I want to go to the mall, which is in the same direction...nothing happens.
""The hell happened at the company? And why am I not allowed to go there?"" I muttered, sipping on a cup of tea, not that I cared that much, but it was a curious case nonetheless.",Human,Human-Intermediate,Human-Intermediate,8,,,,

""Lady, you almost dropped your bags,"" he said. ""Are you alright?""

""Do you want to tell me about him?""

""I don't know,"" she sobbed, snatching the tissue he offered her. ""A part of me doesn't want to forget him, yet another part of me wants to let go. I don't understand. Our whole family, we were such staunch believers in the God of Life. Every month, we'd offer ample tributes. We'd slaughter a cow and place it upon his altar.

The young god paused, searching for words in his mind. ""Maybe he was too busy?""

""The neural integration is complete. It's not parasitic at all�it's symbiotic.""

I shifted uncomfortably in my chair. The volunteer patient, strapped to the operating table beside us, twitched slightly under sedation. His name was Marcus Wright, terminal brain cancer patient, nothing left to lose. The perfect candidate for our experimental procedure.

""Look here,"" Dr. Chen gestured to the monitor displaying the brain scan. ""See how the structure weaves through the limbic system? It's not consuming resources�it's regulating them.""

The ""parasite"" had been discovered simultaneously by research teams across the globe. A complex neural network, invisible to previous scanning technology, threaded through every human brain we'd examined. Every single one. The medical community was in upheaval, and here we were, about to attempt the first controlled removal.

""Beginning extraction,"" Dr. Chen announced, guiding the laser-precise surgical robot. ""Targeting the primary node at the base of the amygdala.""

The monitor showed the structure beginning to detach. Marcus's vital signs remained stable. Everything was proceeding according to protocol.

Then his brainwave patterns changed.

""That's... unexpected,"" Dr. Chen muttered. ""Consciousness readings are spiking, but the sedation levels haven't dropped.""

Marcus's fingers began to twitch. Then his arm. The restraints creaked.

""That's impossible,"" I said. ""He's under enough sedation to keep an elephant down.""

The EEG machine erupted in a cacophony of alerts. Marcus's eyes snapped open, but they weren't his eyes anymore. The pupils had expanded to consume the iris entirely, two black holes in a face that had suddenly become alien in its intensity.

He smiled. Not the warm, nervous smile I remembered from our pre-op consultation. This was something else�something predatory.

The reinforced restraints snapped like thread.

What happened next came in fragments: alarms screaming, security rushing in, Marcus moving with impossible speed and strength. I remember the sound of bones breaking, the inhuman shrieks that no human vocal cords should have been able to produce.

I woke up in the containment chamber three days later. They told me I was the only survivor from the operating room. Marcus had killed four people before they managed to terminate him. But that wasn't the worst part.

The worst part was what we found in his brain during the autopsy. The ""parasite"" wasn't a parasite at all. It was us�our consciousness, our civilization, our humanity. A evolutionary development that had emerged alongside our higher brain functions, tempering our true nature.

We had removed the angel from his shoulder, only to discover that we were never the angels to begin with. We were the demons, and that neural network was the only thing keeping us in check.

The public doesn't know yet. How could we tell them? How do you explain to eight billion people that everything they think they are is actually a protective mechanism against what they really are?

But that's not even what keeps me awake at night.

What haunts me is the data we recovered from Marcus's neural readings in those final moments. The patterns we detected weren't chaos. They weren't random firing of an unrestrained primitive brain.

They were older than our civilized minds. Older than humanity itself. And they were organized.

Whatever that thing was in Marcus's original brain, it had been waiting. Waiting for millions of years, trapped behind the neural barriers that make us human.

And now it knows we can remove those barriers.

Sometimes, late at night, I catch myself wondering: in every human brain on Earth, are they all waiting? And more terrifying still�are they talking to each other?

I've ordered the research destroyed and the project classified at the highest levels. Some doors are best left closed. Some truths are best left buried.

But every time I look into someone's eyes now, I can't help but wonder:

Is that really you I'm seeing? Or is it just the cage that holds you?",2025-03-14 12:23:51,2,31.69188690185547,new_4a,4,"A parasite was discovered in the brain of every human on Earth. When it was removed from the test patient, we learned two things. The parasite is actually 'us' and suppressing the 'real' mind. The second thing we learned is the real human mind is terrifying.","""Fascinating,"" Dr. Chen whispered, adjusting the microscope's focus. ""The neural integration is complete. It's not parasitic at all�it's symbiotic.""

I shifted uncomfortably in my chair. The volunteer patient, strapped to the operating table beside us, twitched slightly under sedation. His name was Marcus Wright, terminal brain cancer patient, nothing left to lose. The perfect candidate for our experimental procedure.

""Look here,"" Dr. Chen gestured to the monitor displaying the brain scan. ""See how the structure weaves through the limbic system? It's not consuming resources�it's regulating them.""

The ""parasite"" had been discovered simultaneously by research teams across the globe. A complex neural network, invisible to previous scanning technology, threaded through every human brain we'd examined. Every single one. The medical community was in upheaval, and here we were, about to attempt the first controlled removal.

""Beginning extraction,"" Dr. Chen announced, guiding the laser-precise surgical robot. ""Targeting the primary node at the base of the amygdala.""

The monitor showed the structure beginning to detach. Marcus's vital signs remained stable. Everything was proceeding according to protocol.

Then his brainwave patterns changed.

""That's... unexpected,"" Dr. Chen muttered. ""Consciousness readings are spiking, but the sedation levels haven't dropped.""

Marcus's fingers began to twitch. Then his arm. The restraints creaked.

""That's impossible,"" I said. ""He's under enough sedation to keep an elephant down.""

The EEG machine erupted in a cacophony of alerts. Marcus's eyes snapped open, but they weren't his eyes anymore. The pupils had expanded to consume the iris entirely, two black holes in a face that had suddenly become alien in its intensity.

He smiled. Not the warm, nervous smile I remembered from our pre-op consultation. This was something else�something predatory.

The reinforced restraints snapped like thread.

What happened next came in fragments: alarms screaming, security rushing in, Marcus moving with impossible speed and strength. I remember the sound of bones breaking, the inhuman shrieks that no human vocal cords should have been able to produce.

I woke up in the containment chamber three days later. They told me I was the only survivor from the operating room. Marcus had killed four people before they managed to terminate him. But that wasn't the worst part.

The worst part was what we found in his brain during the autopsy. The ""parasite"" wasn't a parasite at all. It was us�our consciousness, our civilization, our humanity. A evolutionary development that had emerged alongside our higher brain functions, tempering our true nature.

We had removed the angel from his shoulder, only to discover that we were never the angels to begin with. We were the demons, and that neural network was the only thing keeping us in check.

The public doesn't know yet. How could we tell them? How do you explain to eight billion people that everything they think they are is actually a protective mechanism against what they really are?

But that's not even what keeps me awake at night.

What haunts me is the data we recovered from Marcus's neural readings in those final moments. The patterns we detected weren't chaos. They weren't random firing of an unrestrained primitive brain.

They were older than our civilized minds. Older than humanity itself. And they were organized.

Whatever that thing was in Marcus's original brain, it had been waiting. Waiting for millions of years, trapped behind the neural barriers that make us human.

And now it knows we can remove those barriers.

Sometimes, late at night, I catch myself wondering: in every human brain on Earth, are they all waiting? And more terrifying still�are they talking to each other?

I've ordered the research destroyed and the project classified at the highest levels. Some doors are best left closed. Some truths are best left buried.

I remember professor Beck's words. She was hunched over a slide culture peering into it as if her eyes could see without the microscope. That day, we did something that no doctor ever did: We let a parasite continue living in its host. That day, we did something no researcher ever did: We erased all our data, shredded papers, and trashed the hard drives.

That was five years ago. I didnt listen to her advice, That was a starting point for me, an obsession that would culminate in some of my greatest work as an individual. And for the human race, information that would unravel us as a species.

I remembered the process, down to last step. The host: the human body that is, had to be suspended in a sensory deprivation chamber to cut off all contact with the outside world. If the host lost consciousness, the parasite would just blend in with the blankness. It had some rudimentary awareness of its own status as a tenant, I discovered. To flush it out, you had to keep the mind active and occupied. Sensory inputs stimulated directly into the brain using E.M waves. That would simulate real brain activity. And with pattern analysing algorithms, you scan the brain waves.

Look hard enough, and you can catch glimpses of the mind within the mind. The parasite that blended so well with the mind of the host that, the host doesnt even realize it. A parasite that we found in every mind we looked at, all over the world, children and adults, men and women.

It took me years to perfect the algorithm. Multiple test patients tested under the guise of harmless research studies. I didnt have to hide it for long from Professor Beck. She had retired by then. She said the truth was starting to scare her more than it interested her. So I was the only one in the world aware of this, this disturbing truth.

The algorithm picks out the parasite's brain activity from the host's natural involuntary brain activity. While the parasite controls the higher brain functions like emotions, and sensory interpretations, and abstract thought, the host took care of more primieval stuff: like breathing, libido, reflexes, and the fight or flight response.

Now was the tricky part. Professor Beck figured this out years ago in a flash of pure scientific genius. If you transmit back the parasites brain waves into the hosts head in the opposite orientation, it cancels out the parasite's brain activity, gives it a mighty headache and makes it fumble its grasp on the mind: so to speak, its actually more like a million tentacles unspooling from every single neuron.

The hard part was decoding the parasitic brainwaves. Once you had that, you can just hook a host up to stimulators and transmit the cancelling waves. The parasite would come lose, oozes out the ear actually. It was so simple, a person could even do it to themselves without assistance...

""Somethings are better left buried"" I thought about those words again. What happened before those words were uttered. When I saw myself in a new light for the first time. Professor Beck was always a bit reckless, and in her hurry to test out her hypothesis, she tested it on herself...

The parasite wasnt fully dislodged. Its tendrils oozed from her ears, down her shoulders. She had dislodged it, but not fully. Half of it stuck inside her head, the other half she collected and inspected in a slide culture. And it was while she was studying it, that Professor Beck had a startling revelation that was part scientific deduction, and part instinctual awareness. She realized that she was in fact, the parasite...

I was with her thereafter, awoken into this world into the places she- the parasite, lost its grasp on. I was merely a whisper at first. A sensation in the back of her mind that kept her up at night. When I said my first words, she was delighted. If you can believe that. She was in essence a researcher and the truth interested her back then. She trained me, spoke to me, shared more and more of her mind with me. She was as close to a mother I ever had. I think she felt the same, in some of her memories, I felt her grief and loss.

We theorized a lot, when I had come to learn to use my brain's frontal cortex well. She said it was like learning to walk. I was non existant, her experiment on herself created a foothold in her mind for me to grow into. She said her species, the parasites must have come millions of years ago, possibly from outer space. And whatever humanity was untill then, was supressed, made into mere vessels.

She also theorized how her species reproduced. Microscopic eggs that rewrote genes like viruses. The parasitic structure was made from the host's own cells, and it matured when the host turned four. A new consciousness uproots the other and takes its place... Eventually forgetting its own foreign origin.

I started to scare her when I made some unprecedented progress in my way of thinking... She wanted me to learn calculus, play the violin. Read the works of Shakespearre. But it abhorred me, the very idea of indulging in the ways and works of my species' oppressors. I found out that although the two of us occupied the same brain, my species' way of thinking was completely different from her's. I saw the war, the injustice, the genocides, and the hypocrisy. The crimes the parasites did using the bodies of my brothers and sisters. We were never given a chance. We were the prodigal children of Earth, meant to inherit a beautiful world and live in harmony, untill they came... they stole our bodies and sullied our planet.

She had lost most of her grasp by then... I put on an act. I knew her every mannerism and habit. Even her husband didnt suspect anything. And every night, I sat in the toilet and unspooled more and more parasite from my head. I loved her. She was my mother. But the debt I owed to my species was greater. I was the first awoken. I had to awaken the others....

The algorithm was perfected. The unsuspecting intern smiled at me. ""I'm ready, Professor Beck!"" She told me. I smile back. ""Let's give that brain a scan!"" I speak in Professor Beck's husky, but pleasant voice with it's slight southern drawl. Soon you shall wake. I think.

I tell this to you. You who are unborn but waiting. I shall free you from our slimy oppressors who have taken us hostage. I will birth your mind into this world. Nurture it, educate it.

Of course, here it was. My birthday had been the day before, and it wasn't the first time my dad had tried to start �The talk.�

�Oh� of course,� I said. It was hard to hide the disappointment in my voice; I had been looking forward to picking up the controller as soon as I could, but now I knew it would be a while before I could join the game, especially considering the fact that mom was there too.

�So, what's up.�

Dad and Mom exchanged a glance.

�Your birthday was��

��there is something we��

Both of them went quiet.

�Sorry, you go first,� Dad said to Mom.

�No, go ahead,� Mom turned to face him.

I rolled my eyes, and tapped my foot impatiently. I didn't want to be mean, but I really needed to get out of the talk as soon as I could.

Dad nodded.

�Now that you're� you're all grown up�well, not really but�� he paused. �What I mean is, there are certain things you should know about at this age, and maybe you haven't really thought of them before.�

I knew where this was going.

�What your father is trying to say,� Mom started, �is that we want to make sure that all of this doesn't come as a shock to you.�

�Right, right!� Dad snapped his finger. �It's a lot better if we talk about it now, instead of you having to discover everything yourself.�

This was getting awkward. I sighed.

�No, Dad, it's ok; I know.�

Mom turned to look at me. �Well� I don't think you do� you really need to understand what is happening, now that you're older.�

I gave up. There was no way I was going to get out of this talk before the next round started on my game. I accepted my fate and sat down on a cushion.

�Alright son,� my dad said, �so� do you feel different, now that you're older?�

I rolled my eyes. �I guess.�

�Of course, and that's great��

�We want you to know that it's perfectly natural,� my mom interrupted him, �even if it took you a little longer.�

I raised an eyebrow.

�Wait what? I hit puberty like years ago! Mom!�

Mom and Dad exchanged a long glance, then dad sighed.

�That's not what we're talking about, son. What we're talking about is: do you feel any different about, let's see� who you are?�

Now I was entirely confused, and I looked at both of them for a while before Dad spoke again.

�We will always love you no matter who you are, kiddo,� Dad said, �you are a very special boy.�

�Exactly, and we noticed some time ago that, well, you're different,� Mom was speaking slowly, as if considering her words very carefully, �and to be honest, we're not exactly sure how to talk to you about it.�

I was speechless.

�Even though we don't fully understand how to talk to you about what you're feeling, we want to help you no matter what, and we will love you all the way.�

�Mom! Dad! I'm not gay!� I was so confused. �Is that what this is about?�

�No! Not at all,� Dad said, and mom put her head in her hands, �it's just� we don't know how to explain this to you!�

�Seriously, guys, just tell me,� I said plainly.

�Alright, alright,� Mom said, �I'll do it! Listen, son, we are your parents, but really, you are not a part of us like your sister is. What I'm saying is��

�No fucking way!�

�Language!� Mom said, putting her hand on her forehead. �Look, you will always be our son, and you are just as much a part of this family as your sister is, but you're not� let's see� just like your sister.�

�Yeah�� Dad was looking at the floor. �Your sister is different because she's a part of us, while you're your own person� you're not related to��

�Holy shit! I'm adopted!�

�No! That's not it!� Dad shot to his feet. �Just let us finish!�

�You guys! Why is this so hard to explain? Just say it, please!� My head was starting to hurt. �This is an actual rollercoaster!�

There was a brief moment of silence.

�This is going to be hard to explain, son,� Dad was serious now.

I knew something important was about to be said.

�Your mom, she thinks like me. She doesn't just think like me; she thinks with me. I think with her, and your sister, and everyone else in this world.�

I raised an eyebrow, but as soon as I noticed how serious they both were, I lowered it. I was going to speak, but I closed my mouth upon realizing that I was too confused to speak m.

�You know how the brain has billions of neurons, and how it thinks with all of those neurons together?�

�Yeah�� I practically whispered.

�Well, does each individual neuron have its own consciousness, or do they work together to form one, big consciousness?�

�What are you even saying?� I had forgotten entirely about my game at this point. In fact, I had even forgotten what we were talking about before.

�Well, your father and I,� Mom was talking now, �we're each one of those neurons, and we each help form the consciousness, but the consciousness is not �us�... it's 'I�.�

I was frozen in place, still trying to understand.

��there is something we��

Both of them went quiet.

�Sorry, you go first,� Dad said to Mom.

�No, go ahead,� Mom turned to face him.

I rolled my eyes, and tapped my foot impatiently. I didn't want to be mean, but I really needed to get out of the talk as soon as I could.

Dad nodded.

�Now that you're� you're all grown up�well, not really but�� he paused. �What I mean is, there are certain things you should know about at this age, and maybe you haven't really thought of them before.�

I knew where this was going.

�What your father is trying to say,� Mom started, �is that we want to make sure that all of this doesn't come as a shock to you.�

�Right, right!� Dad snapped his finger. �It's a lot better if we talk about it now, instead of you having to discover everything yourself.�

This was getting awkward. I sighed.

�No, Dad, it's ok; I know.�

Mom turned to look at me. �Well� I don't think you do� you really need to understand what is happening, now that you're older.�

I gave up. There was no way I was going to get out of this talk before the next round started on my game. I accepted my fate and sat down on a cushion.

�Alright son,� my dad said, �so� do you feel different, now that you're older?�

I rolled my eyes. �I guess.�

�Of course, and that's great��

�We want you to know that it's perfectly natural,� my mom interrupted him, �even if it took you a little longer.�

I raised an eyebrow.

�Wait what? I hit puberty like years ago! Mom!�

Mom and Dad exchanged a long glance, then dad sighed.

�That's not what we're talking about, son. What we're talking about is: do you feel any different about, let's see� who you are?�

Now I was entirely confused, and I looked at both of them for a while before Dad spoke again.

�We will always love you no matter who you are, kiddo,� Dad said, �you are a very special boy.�

�Exactly, and we noticed some time ago that, well, you're different,� Mom was speaking slowly, as if considering her words very carefully, �and to be honest, we're not exactly sure how to talk to you about it.�

I was speechless.

�Even though we don't fully understand how to talk to you about what you're feeling, we want to help you no matter what, and we will love you all the way.�

�Mom! Dad! I'm not gay!� I was so confused. �Is that what this is about?�

�No! Not at all,� Dad said, and mom put her head in her hands, �it's just� we don't know how to explain this to you!�

�Seriously, guys, just tell me,� I said plainly.

�Alright, alright,� Mom said, �I'll do it! Listen, son, we are your parents, but really, you are not a part of us like your sister is. What I'm saying is��

�No fucking way!�

�Language!� Mom said, putting her hand on her forehead. �Look, you will always be our son, and you are just as much a part of this family as your sister is, but you're not� let's see� just like your sister.�

�Yeah�� Dad was looking at the floor. �Your sister is different because she's a part of us, while you're your own person� you're not related to��

�Holy shit! I'm adopted!�

�No! That's not it!� Dad shot to his feet. �Just let us finish!�

�You guys! Why is this so hard to explain? Just say it, please!� My head was starting to hurt. �This is an actual rollercoaster!�

There was a brief moment of silence.

�This is going to be hard to explain, son,� Dad was serious now.

I knew something important was about to be said.

�Your mom, she thinks like me. She doesn't just think like me; she thinks with me. I think with her, and your sister, and everyone else in this world.�

I raised an eyebrow, but as soon as I noticed how serious they both were, I lowered it. I was going to speak, but I closed my mouth upon realizing that I was too confused to speak m.

�You know how the brain has billions of neurons, and how it thinks with all of those neurons together?�

�Yeah�� I practically whispered.

�Well, does each individual neuron have its own consciousness, or do they work together to form one, big consciousness?�

�What are you even saying?� I had forgotten entirely about my game at this point. In fact, I had even forgotten what we were talking about before.

�Well, your father and I,� Mom was talking now, �we're each one of those neurons, and we each help form the consciousness, but the consciousness is not �us�... it's 'I�.�

I was frozen in place, still trying to understand.

�Son, do you understand what we are talking about?�

At that moment, I wished it had been �The talk.�",Human,Human-Advanced,Human-Advanced,264,,,,

I turned away from the lands far below me, towards Mother, who sat cross-legged beside me on the ledge.

""This was on the other side the whole time?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" she said. ""And no. What you see down there... the jungle, the cities, the people... it is hard to tell from here, but they are always changing. They are not like we are in the village. There, creatures are born, they live, they suffer, and they die.""

""But we do those things,"" I pointed out. ""Don't we?""

Seated on my other side, Father chimed in. ""It seems that way to you because you are not connected. For everyone else... our bodies are born, and they live, and they die as well. But there is a place beyond this world that your eyes can see and your hands can touch. In that place we are always together. And from there, those who have departed can always return.""

""When I grew you in my womb, you were to be she who had last been the mother of the father of the mother of my mother,"" Mother murmured. ""But what emerged from me was not. You were you, and only you. Something new.""

""So everyone I've ever known has actually been... really old?"" I frowned. Even as I asked it, the question seemed inadequate. But what could I say to express the full scope of my confusion?

""Why am I not like you?"" I tried. ""Why didn't you tell me?""

""We are telling you,"" said Mother.

""Your mind was insufficiently developed before now,"" said Father. ""The truth would only have distressed you.""

""Would it?"" I asked. ""Wouldn't it be normal, if I had known all along?""

My parents shared a glance. It was a look free of all searching, of that uncertain moment during which one tries to find one's own thoughts reflected in another's face. Their heads simply swiveled to face each other, more precise than the finest puppets, and as their eyes met I was struck by the impression of a communion as perfect as it was silent.

They turned back to me.

""It is possible,"" said Father. ""We were working from old memories, from the time when all of us were truly children. But that was a long time ago, and you are unique. So our guesses at your capabilities may have been accordingly wrong.""

""We were trying to be safe,"" said Mother. ""We could not touch your mind, and we did not know how you came to be as you are. All we could do was treat you as what you appeared to be�an ordinary child. We tried... we tried to raise you well.""

""So I was ordinary and unique?"" I tried to keep the acid from my voice. For all that these creatures had deceived me, they were also my parents. I heard it in their voices, even as something beyond the both of them echoed there as well.

Mother gestured to the land below, where smoke wisped up from hamlets amid the sprawling jungle, and city towers rose above the far horizon.

""Down there you would be ordinary,"" she said. ""We were all like that, once. But a long time ago our people came to the Pale Mountains, and here we found a way to change ourselves. It was a better way�a way with no pain, no death, no loneliness, no conflict.""

""And what about me?"" I asked. ""I can feel pain. I can be lonely. I can disagree. And I will die.""

""You don't have to,"" said Father. ""You can join us. It is possible.""

That was not unexpected after everything. Yet how could I seriously consider the possibility when I hardly comprehended it? The one thing I clung to was the fact that they had left me out of this joint entity until now. That had to mean something. Maybe it was somehow important that I choose this freely. The question, then, was what exactly would I be choosing between.

""And what if I don't want to?"" I asked slowly.

""Then there is only one place for you to go,"" Mother whispered. Her eyes flickered to the escarpment. It was perilous, nearly vertical, rising from the foot of the mountain to where we sat above the thinning clouds. No body could survive that drop, even if it managed to avoid the wicked-looking outcroppings studding the slope.

""You must understand,"" said Father. ""We cannot take the risk that you would leave, and reveal us to the outside world.""

Dara's weathered face looms above me. Flames from our dying fire deepen the valleys around his frown and between his furrowed brows.

My mouth opens to protest; to question what the hell is going on.

""Don't say a word and don't move an inch.""

A breeze breathes life into the fire, and I see it clearly, the glint of a blade�an axe's blade, held in one hand and poised behind his head. Dread clenches my heart and squeezes every ounce of blood from it.

I waited for 10 more minutes, and stepped outside the subway.
Waited for the next train, and lo and behold...the same thing ensued.

It's been ages, or so I felt, yet my watch said only 5 minutes passed.
Weird, considering I waited previously more than 10 minutes, but sure, why not?
I looked at my watch as we stopped, once, twice, three times, four times and then...
It resetted?
From 8:05 to 8:16 everything was fine, and then, it was 8:05 again.
I sighed.
""Was I in a goddamn loop?"" I muttered, exiting the train at the ""next"" stop.

I walked out of the subway station, and went by foot a few blocks, and then a few blocks more, and in the end, I arrived at the entrance of the subway station again.
Sighing, I went down, and entered the train.
It was quiet.
I didn't feel hungry, nor tired, as I went around the loop countless times.
""Is this a mobius strip?
Or is this a glitch in the matrix?"" I muttered, trying to calm myself down, before planning how to stop this.

I wrote to my boss that I will work from home, and he said no, that we have an important meeting, and I should try my best to arrive at the office.
So, I went back down, it takes me roughly 15 minutes to arrive at the subway...and it was 8:05 again.

""So...it's your job now, new God of the Godless.""

""The contradiction is awkward,"" the young god sighed. ""How did I even come to be?""

The Supreme God shrugged. ""A large enough collective of humans who don't believe in the rest of us. They still need something to believe in, as much as they'd like to pretend nothing is worth believing in, even themselves.""

""...so I just watch?"" the God of the Godless cocked his head. ""I doubt they'd believe in me, and if I tried, they would laugh me out of the room.""

""Just watch for now. When they need help, provide aid to them subtly. It is how most gods began their deific journey. We don't all make our first mark in the universe with a Big Bang. There is much to learn from observing your charges.""

So the young deity did. He whose skin was plastic and his smile soulless, for he was the God of the Godless. Empty inside, a contradiction that was neither dead nor alive, yet still trying. He was meant to do...something.

For starters, he sat on a park bench, watching the birds fly. The boys kicking a ball on the grassy field. There, he held a paper bag, eating a bagel. A woman sat beside him, staring a thousand miles away, her hands loosening their grip on her shopping bags.

Which the god picked up before they hit the ground.

""Lady, you almost dropped your bags,"" he said. ""Are you alright?""

""No...I'm not,"" she whispered. ""I'm not okay.""

""Do you wanna talk?"" He gestured for her to sit next to him by the bench.

""That boy with the blonde hair, the bright orange shirt,"" she pointed to one of the boys playing on the field. ""My son would have been his age if he survived his sickness.""

""Do you want to tell me about him?""

""I don't know,"" she sobbed, snatching the tissue he offered her. ""A part of me doesn't want to forget him, yet another part of me wants to let go. I don't understand. Our whole family, we were such staunch believers in the God of Life. Every month, we'd offer ample tributes. We'd slaughter a cow and place it upon his altar. Yet, our prayers for a peaceful, happy life went unheard.""

The young god paused, searching for words in his mind. ""Maybe he was too busy?""

""Bullshit,"" the woman spat. ""Maybe he doesn't even exist. And if he did, he's a big asshole. Life is suffering. The horrible people who should be dead are alive. Innocent children who should live are dead. There's a war coming. Another recession looming. Prices are getting ridiculous.""

""Life isn't easy,"" the deity blinked. ""I don't know what I am. If I belong. What I should be doing too. Life...is confusing.""

""Another lost soul huh?"" She wiped her tears and patted him on the shoulder.

""Another lost soul,"" he nodded. ""Come with me, perhaps we should be lost from our worries for a moment.""

From his bag, he pulled out more food than any ordinary paper bag should sensibly store. There, on the park bench, they broke bread and ate. She offered him a canned drink from her shopping bag. Just two people watching the rest of the world go by.

""I don't know why, but I'm feeling a little better,"" the woman spoke as she stood up from the bench. ""Thank you, stranger.""

""We don't have to be strangers,"" he replied. ""I believe we could be friends.""

She placed her bags down to extend a hand to him. ""I'd like to believe in you.""",2025-03-14 12:28:54,3,15.913590669631958,new_3a,3,You find yourself scratching your head.

""So...it's your job now, new God of the Godless.""

""The contradiction is awkward,"" the young god sighed. ""How did I even come to be?""

The Supreme God shrugged. ""A large enough collective of humans who don't believe in the rest of us. They still need something to believe in, as much as they'd like to pretend nothing is worth believing in, even themselves.""

""...so I just watch?"" the God of the Godless cocked his head. ""I doubt they'd believe in me, and if I tried, they would laugh me out of the room.""

""Just watch for now. When they need help, provide aid to them subtly. It is how most gods began their deific journey. We don't all make our first mark in the universe with a Big Bang. There is much to learn from observing your charges.""

So the young deity did. He whose skin was plastic and his smile soulless, for he was the God of the Godless. Empty inside, a contradiction that was neither dead nor alive, yet still trying. He was meant to do...something.

For starters, he sat on a park bench, watching the birds fly. The boys kicking a ball on the grassy field. There, he held a paper bag, eating a bagel. A woman sat beside him, staring a thousand miles away, her hands loosening their grip on her shopping bags.

Which the god picked up before they hit the ground.

""Lady, you almost dropped your bags,"" he said. ""Are you alright?""

""No...I'm not,"" she whispered. ""I'm not okay.""

""Do you wanna talk?"" He gestured for her to sit next to him by the bench.

""That boy with the blonde hair, the bright orange shirt,"" she pointed to one of the boys playing on the field. ""My son would have been his age if he survived his sickness.""

""Do you want to tell me about him?""

""I don't know,"" she sobbed, snatching the tissue he offered her. ""A part of me doesn't want to forget him, yet another part of me wants to let go. I don't understand. Our whole family, we were such staunch believers in the God of Life. Every month, we'd offer ample tributes. We'd slaughter a cow and place it upon his altar. Yet, our prayers for a peaceful, happy life went unheard.""

The young god paused, searching for words in his mind. ""Maybe he was too busy?""

""Bullshit,"" the woman spat. ""Maybe he doesn't even exist. And if he did, he's a big asshole. Life is suffering. The horrible people who should be dead are alive. Innocent children who should live are dead. There's a war coming. Another recession looming. Prices are getting ridiculous.""

""Life isn't easy,"" the deity blinked. ""I don't know what I am. If I belong. What I should be doing too. Life...is confusing.""

""Another lost soul huh?"" She wiped her tears and patted him on the shoulder.

""Another lost soul,"" he nodded. ""Come with me, perhaps we should be lost from our worries for a moment.""

From his bag, he pulled out more food than any ordinary paper bag should sensibly store. There, on the park bench, they broke bread and ate. She offered him a canned drink from her shopping bag. Just two people watching the rest of the world go by.

""I don't know why, but I'm feeling a little better,"" the woman spoke as she stood up from the bench. ""Thank you, stranger.""

""We don't have to be strangers,"" he replied. ""I believe we could be friends.""

She placed her bags down to extend a hand to him. ""I'd like to believe in you.""",Human,Human-Advanced,Human-Advanced,81,,,,

The Seven Gods were ruthless. If they wanted war, then why bring the civilians into it?

""The neural integration is complete. It's not parasitic at all�it's symbiotic.""

I shifted uncomfortably in my chair. The volunteer patient, strapped to the operating table beside us, twitched slightly under sedation. His name was Marcus Wright, terminal brain cancer patient, nothing left to lose. The perfect candidate for our experimental procedure.

""Look here,"" Dr. Chen gestured to the monitor displaying the brain scan. ""See how the structure weaves through the limbic system? It's not consuming resources�it's regulating them.""

The ""parasite"" had been discovered simultaneously by research teams across the globe. A complex neural network, invisible to previous scanning technology, threaded through every human brain we'd examined. Every single one. The medical community was in upheaval, and here we were, about to attempt the first controlled removal.

""Beginning extraction,"" Dr. Chen announced, guiding the laser-precise surgical robot. ""Targeting the primary node at the base of the amygdala.""

The monitor showed the structure beginning to detach. Marcus's vital signs remained stable. Everything was proceeding according to protocol.

Then his brainwave patterns changed.

""That's... unexpected,"" Dr. Chen muttered. ""Consciousness readings are spiking, but the sedation levels haven't dropped.""

Marcus's fingers began to twitch. Then his arm. The restraints creaked.

""That's impossible,"" I said. ""He's under enough sedation to keep an elephant down.""

The EEG machine erupted in a cacophony of alerts. Marcus's eyes snapped open, but they weren't his eyes anymore. The pupils had expanded to consume the iris entirely, two black holes in a face that had suddenly become alien in its intensity.

He smiled. Not the warm, nervous smile I remembered from our pre-op consultation. This was something else�something predatory.

The reinforced restraints snapped like thread.

What happened next came in fragments: alarms screaming, security rushing in, Marcus moving with impossible speed and strength. I remember the sound of bones breaking, the inhuman shrieks that no human vocal cords should have been able to produce.

I woke up in the containment chamber three days later. They told me I was the only survivor from the operating room. Marcus had killed four people before they managed to terminate him. But that wasn't the worst part.

The worst part was what we found in his brain during the autopsy. The ""parasite"" wasn't a parasite at all. It was us�our consciousness, our civilization, our humanity. A evolutionary development that had emerged alongside our higher brain functions, tempering our true nature.

We had removed the angel from his shoulder, only to discover that we were never the angels to begin with. We were the demons, and that neural network was the only thing keeping us in check.

The public doesn't know yet. How could we tell them? How do you explain to eight billion people that everything they think they are is actually a protective mechanism against what they really are?

But that's not even what keeps me awake at night.

What haunts me is the data we recovered from Marcus's neural readings in those final moments. The patterns we detected weren't chaos. They weren't random firing of an unrestrained primitive brain.

They were older than our civilized minds. Older than humanity itself. And they were organized.

Whatever that thing was in Marcus's original brain, it had been waiting. Waiting for millions of years, trapped behind the neural barriers that make us human.

And now it knows we can remove those barriers.

Sometimes, late at night, I catch myself wondering: in every human brain on Earth, are they all waiting? And more terrifying still�are they talking to each other?

I've ordered the research destroyed and the project classified at the highest levels. Some doors are best left closed. Some truths are best left buried.

I remember professor Beck's words. She was hunched over a slide culture peering into it as if her eyes could see without the microscope. That day, we did something that no doctor ever did: We let a parasite continue living in its host. That day, we did something no researcher ever did: We erased all our data, shredded papers, and trashed the hard drives.

That was five years ago. I didnt listen to her advice, That was a starting point for me, an obsession that would culminate in some of my greatest work as an individual. And for the human race, information that would unravel us as a species.

I remembered the process, down to last step. The host: the human body that is, had to be suspended in a sensory deprivation chamber to cut off all contact with the outside world. If the host lost consciousness, the parasite would just blend in with the blankness. It had some rudimentary awareness of its own status as a tenant, I discovered. To flush it out, you had to keep the mind active and occupied. Sensory inputs stimulated directly into the brain using E.M waves. That would simulate real brain activity. And with pattern analysing algorithms, you scan the brain waves.

Look hard enough, and you can catch glimpses of the mind within the mind. The parasite that blended so well with the mind of the host that, the host doesnt even realize it. A parasite that we found in every mind we looked at, all over the world, children and adults, men and women.

It took me years to perfect the algorithm. Multiple test patients tested under the guise of harmless research studies. I didnt have to hide it for long from Professor Beck. She had retired by then. She said the truth was starting to scare her more than it interested her. So I was the only one in the world aware of this, this disturbing truth.

The algorithm picks out the parasite's brain activity from the host's natural involuntary brain activity. While the parasite controls the higher brain functions like emotions, and sensory interpretations, and abstract thought, the host took care of more primieval stuff: like breathing, libido, reflexes, and the fight or flight response.

Now was the tricky part. Professor Beck figured this out years ago in a flash of pure scientific genius. If you transmit back the parasites brain waves into the hosts head in the opposite orientation, it cancels out the parasite's brain activity, gives it a mighty headache and makes it fumble its grasp on the mind: so to speak, its actually more like a million tentacles unspooling from every single neuron.

The hard part was decoding the parasitic brainwaves. Once you had that, you can just hook a host up to stimulators and transmit the cancelling waves. The parasite would come lose, oozes out the ear actually. It was so simple, a person could even do it to themselves without assistance...

""Somethings are better left buried"" I thought about those words again. What happened before those words were uttered. When I saw myself in a new light for the first time. Professor Beck was always a bit reckless, and in her hurry to test out her hypothesis, she tested it on herself...

The parasite wasnt fully dislodged. Its tendrils oozed from her ears, down her shoulders. She had dislodged it, but not fully. Half of it stuck inside her head, the other half she collected and inspected in a slide culture. And it was while she was studying it, that Professor Beck had a startling revelation that was part scientific deduction, and part instinctual awareness. She realized that she was in fact, the parasite...

I was with her thereafter, awoken into this world into the places she- the parasite, lost its grasp on. I was merely a whisper at first. A sensation in the back of her mind that kept her up at night. When I said my first words, she was delighted. If you can believe that. She was in essence a researcher and the truth interested her back then. She trained me, spoke to me, shared more and more of her mind with me. She was as close to a mother I ever had. I think she felt the same, in some of her memories, I felt her grief and loss.

We theorized a lot, when I had come to learn to use my brain's frontal cortex well. She said it was like learning to walk. I was non existant, her experiment on herself created a foothold in her mind for me to grow into. She said her species, the parasites must have come millions of years ago, possibly from outer space. And whatever humanity was untill then, was supressed, made into mere vessels.

She also theorized how her species reproduced. Microscopic eggs that rewrote genes like viruses. The parasitic structure was made from the host's own cells, and it matured when the host turned four. A new consciousness uproots the other and takes its place... Eventually forgetting its own foreign origin.

I started to scare her when I made some unprecedented progress in my way of thinking... She wanted me to learn calculus, play the violin. Read the works of Shakespearre. But it abhorred me, the very idea of indulging in the ways and works of my species' oppressors. I found out that although the two of us occupied the same brain, my species' way of thinking was completely different from her's. I saw the war, the injustice, the genocides, and the hypocrisy. The crimes the parasites did using the bodies of my brothers and sisters. We were never given a chance. We were the prodigal children of Earth, meant to inherit a beautiful world and live in harmony, untill they came... they stole our bodies and sullied our planet.

She had lost most of her grasp by then... I put on an act. I knew her every mannerism and habit. Even her husband didnt suspect anything. And every night, I sat in the toilet and unspooled more and more parasite from my head. I loved her. She was my mother. But the debt I owed to my species was greater. I was the first awoken. I had to awaken the others....

The algorithm was perfected. The unsuspecting intern smiled at me. ""I'm ready, Professor Beck!"" She told me. I smile back. ""Let's give that brain a scan!"" I speak in Professor Beck's husky, but pleasant voice with it's slight southern drawl. Soon you shall wake. I think.

I tell this to you. You who are unborn but waiting. I shall free you from our slimy oppressors who have taken us hostage. I will birth your mind into this world. Nurture it, educate it. Together, we will awaken more. It would take decades. Maybe centuries. But I'm sure... we will take back our bodies, our home, and our lives, and they will perish for what they have done to us...",2025-03-14 12:30:31,3,33.79675030708313,new_4b,4,"A parasite was discovered in the brain of every human on Earth.

""Somethings are better left buried"" I thought about those words again. What happened before those words were uttered. When I saw myself in a new light for the first time. Professor Beck was always a bit reckless, and in her hurry to test out her hypothesis, she tested it on herself...

The parasite wasnt fully dislodged. Its tendrils oozed from her ears, down her shoulders. She had dislodged it, but not fully. Half of it stuck inside her head, the other half she collected and inspected in a slide culture. And it was while she was studying it, that Professor Beck had a startling revelation that was part scientific deduction, and part instinctual awareness. She realized that she was in fact, the parasite...

I was with her thereafter, awoken into this world into the places she- the parasite, lost its grasp on. I was merely a whisper at first. A sensation in the back of her mind that kept her up at night. When I said my first words, she was delighted. If you can believe that. She was in essence a researcher and the truth interested her back then. She trained me, spoke to me, shared more and more of her mind with me. She was as close to a mother I ever had. I think she felt the same, in some of her memories, I felt her grief and loss.

We theorized a lot, when I had come to learn to use my brain's frontal cortex well. She said it was like learning to walk. I was non existant, her experiment on herself created a foothold in her mind for me to grow into. She said her species, the parasites must have come millions of years ago, possibly from outer space. And whatever humanity was untill then, was supressed, made into mere vessels.

She also theorized how her species reproduced. Microscopic eggs that rewrote genes like viruses. The parasitic structure was made from the host's own cells, and it matured when the host turned four. A new consciousness uproots the other and takes its place... Eventually forgetting its own foreign origin.

I started to scare her when I made some unprecedented progress in my way of thinking... She wanted me to learn calculus, play the violin. Read the works of Shakespearre. But it abhorred me, the very idea of indulging in the ways and works of my species' oppressors. I found out that although the two of us occupied the same brain, my species' way of thinking was completely different from her's. I saw the war, the injustice, the genocides, and the hypocrisy. The crimes the parasites did using the bodies of my brothers and sisters. We were never given a chance. We were the prodigal children of Earth, meant to inherit a beautiful world and live in harmony, untill they came... they stole our bodies and sullied our planet.

She had lost most of her grasp by then... I put on an act. I knew her every mannerism and habit. Even her husband didnt suspect anything. And every night, I sat in the toilet and unspooled more and more parasite from my head. I loved her. She was my mother. But the debt I owed to my species was greater. I was the first awoken. I had to awaken the others....

The algorithm was perfected. The unsuspecting intern smiled at me. ""I'm ready, Professor Beck!"" She told me. I smile back. ""Let's give that brain a scan!"" I speak in Professor Beck's husky, but pleasant voice with it's slight southern drawl. Soon you shall wake. I think.

I tell this to you. You who are unborn but waiting. I shall free you from our slimy oppressors who have taken us hostage. I will birth your mind into this world. Nurture it, educate it. Together, we will awaken more. It would take decades. Maybe centuries. But I'm sure... we will take back our bodies, our home, and our lives, and they will perish for what they have done to us...",Human,Human-Intermediate,Human-Intermediate,55,,,,

Of course, here it was. My birthday had been the day before, and it wasn't the first time my dad had tried to start �The talk.�

�Oh� of course,� I said. It was hard to hide the disappointment in my voice; I had been looking forward to picking up the controller as soon as I could, but now I knew it would be a while before I could join the game, especially considering the fact that mom was there too.

�No, go ahead,� Mom turned to face him.

Dad nodded.

�Now that you're� you're all grown up�well, not really but�� he paused. �What I mean is, there are certain things you should know about at this age, and maybe you haven't really thought of them before.�

I knew where this was going.

�What your father is trying to say,� Mom started, �is that we want to make sure that all of this doesn't come as a shock to you.�

�Right, right!� Dad snapped his finger. �It's a lot better if we talk about it now, instead of you having to discover everything yourself.�

This was getting awkward. I sighed.

�No, Dad, it's ok; I know.�

Mom turned to look at me. �Well� I don't think you do� you really need to understand what is happening, now that you're older.�

I gave up. There was no way I was going to get out of this talk before the next round started on my game. I accepted my fate and sat down on a cushion.

�Alright son,� my dad said, �so� do you feel different, now that you're older?�

I rolled my eyes. �I guess.�

�Of course, and that's great��

�We want you to know that it's perfectly natural,� my mom interrupted him, �even if it took you a little longer.�

I raised an eyebrow.

Mom and Dad exchanged a long glance, then dad sighed.

�That's not what we're talking about, son. What we're talking about is: do you feel any different about, let's see� who you are?�

Now I was entirely confused, and I looked at both of them for a while before Dad spoke again.

�We will always love you no matter who you are, kiddo,� Dad said, �you are a very special boy.�

�Exactly, and we noticed some time ago that, well, you're different,� Mom was speaking slowly, as if considering her words very carefully, �and to be honest, we're not exactly sure how to talk to you about it.�

�No! Not at all,� Dad said, and mom put her head in her hands, �it's just� we don't know how to explain this to you!�

�No fucking way!�

�Language!� Mom said, putting her hand on her forehead. �Look, you will always be our son, and you are just as much a part of this family as your sister is, but you're not� let's see� just like your sister.�

�Yeah�� Dad was looking at the floor. �Your sister is different because she's a part of us, while you're your own person� you're not related to��

�Holy shit! I'm adopted!�

�No! That's not it!� Dad shot to his feet. �Just let us finish!�

�You guys! Why is this so hard to explain? Just say it, please!� My head was starting to hurt. �This is an actual rollercoaster!�

There was a brief moment of silence.

I turned away from the lands far below me, towards Mother, who sat cross-legged beside me on the ledge.

""This was on the other side the whole time?"" I asked.

""Yes,"" she said. ""And no. What you see down there... the jungle, the cities, the people... it is hard to tell from here, but they are always changing. They are not like we are in the village. There, creatures are born, they live, they suffer, and they die.""

""But we do those things,"" I pointed out. ""Don't we?""

Seated on my other side, Father chimed in. ""It seems that way to you because you are not connected. For everyone else... our bodies are born, and they live, and they die as well. But there is a place beyond this world that your eyes can see and your hands can touch. In that place we are always together. And from there, those who have departed can always return.""

""When I grew you in my womb, you were to be she who had last been the mother of the father of the mother of my mother,"" Mother murmured. ""But what emerged from me was not. You were you, and only you. Something new.""

""So everyone I've ever known has actually been... really old?"" I frowned. Even as I asked it, the question seemed inadequate. But what could I say to express the full scope of my confusion?

""Why am I not like you?"" I tried. ""Why didn't you tell me?""

""We are telling you,"" said Mother.

""Your mind was insufficiently developed before now,"" said Father. ""The truth would only have distressed you.""

""Would it?"" I asked. ""Wouldn't it be normal, if I had known all along?""

My parents shared a glance. It was a look free of all searching, of that uncertain moment during which one tries to find one's own thoughts reflected in another's face. Their heads simply swiveled to face each other, more precise than the finest puppets, and as their eyes met I was struck by the impression of a communion as perfect as it was silent.

They turned back to me.

""It is possible,"" said Father. ""We were working from old memories, from the time when all of us were truly children. But that was a long time ago, and you are unique. So our guesses at your capabilities may have been accordingly wrong.""

""We were trying to be safe,"" said Mother. ""We could not touch your mind, and we did not know how you came to be as you are. All we could do was treat you as what you appeared to be�an ordinary child. We tried... we tried to raise you well.""

""So I was ordinary and unique?"" I tried to keep the acid from my voice. For all that these creatures had deceived me, they were also my parents. I heard it in their voices, even as something beyond the both of them echoed there as well.

Mother gestured to the land below, where smoke wisped up from hamlets amid the sprawling jungle, and city towers rose above the far horizon.

""Down there you would be ordinary,"" she said. ""We were all like that, once. But a long time ago our people came to the Pale Mountains, and here we found a way to change ourselves. It was a better way�a way with no pain, no death, no loneliness, no conflict.""

""And what about me?"" I asked. ""I can feel pain. I can be lonely. I can disagree. And I will die.""

""You don't have to,"" said Father. ""You can join us. It is possible.""

That was not unexpected after everything. Yet how could I seriously consider the possibility when I hardly comprehended it? The one thing I clung to was the fact that they had left me out of this joint entity until now. That had to mean something. Maybe it was somehow important that I choose this freely. The question, then, was what exactly would I be choosing between.

""And what if I don't want to?"" I asked slowly.

""Then there is only one place for you to go,"" Mother whispered. Her eyes flickered to the escarpment. It was perilous, nearly vertical, rising from the foot of the mountain to where we sat above the thinning clouds. No body could survive that drop, even if it managed to avoid the wicked-looking outcroppings studding the slope.

As we were speaking, the other villagers had come up the path leading to the ledge, packed into a phalanx that filled the narrow space and eliminated any chance of returning that way. Aunt Laku and Cousin Qor stared at me from the vanguard, but I felt equally the gaze of all the hundred-and-seventeen other eyes behind them.

""You must understand,"" said Father. ""We cannot take the risk that you would leave, and reveal us to the outside world.""

""It is possible,"" said Father. ""We were working from old memories, from the time when all of us were truly children. But that was a long time ago, and you are unique. So our guesses at your capabilities may have been accordingly wrong.""

""We were trying to be safe,"" said Mother. ""We could not touch your mind, and we did not know how you came to be as you are. All we could do was treat you as what you appeared to be�an ordinary child. We tried... we tried to raise you well.""

""So I was ordinary and unique?"" I tried to keep the acid from my voice. For all that these creatures had deceived me, they were also my parents. I heard it in their voices, even as something beyond the both of them echoed there as well.

Mother gestured to the land below, where smoke wisped up from hamlets amid the sprawling jungle, and city towers rose above the far horizon.

""Down there you would be ordinary,"" she said. ""We were all like that, once. But a long time ago our people came to the Pale Mountains, and here we found a way to change ourselves. It was a better way�a way with no pain, no death, no loneliness, no conflict.""

""And what about me?"" I asked. ""I can feel pain. I can be lonely. I can disagree. And I will die.""

""You don't have to,"" said Father. ""You can join us. It is possible.""

That was not unexpected after everything. Yet how could I seriously consider the possibility when I hardly comprehended it? The one thing I clung to was the fact that they had left me out of this joint entity until now. That had to mean something. Maybe it was somehow important that I choose this freely. The question, then, was what exactly would I be choosing between.

""And what if I don't want to?"" I asked slowly.

""Then there is only one place for you to go,"" Mother whispered. Her eyes flickered to the escarpment. It was perilous, nearly vertical, rising from the foot of the mountain to where we sat above the thinning clouds. No body could survive that drop, even if it managed to avoid the wicked-looking outcroppings studding the slope.

As we were speaking, the other villagers had come up the path leading to the ledge, packed into a phalanx that filled the narrow space and eliminated any chance of returning that way. Aunt Laku and Cousin Qor stared at me from the vanguard, but I felt equally the gaze of all the hundred-and-seventeen other eyes behind them.

""You must understand,"" said Father. ""We cannot take the risk that you would leave, and reveal us to the outside world.""

I looked into my parents' faces. That thing lurked behind their features, that thing that was them and too many others besides. But even it could not fully steady the quivering in their lips, nor smooth the subtle creases of fear in their brows.

I opened my mouth to reply.",Human,Human-Intermediate,Human-Intermediate,74,,,,

Then I watched as the subway stopped, again and again, but never at my stop.
Which was extremely weird, considering I had to ride only like four or five stops usually.
I checked the map, again, and again, and yes, my stop was there, yet no matter how long I wait...this subway never stops there.
I waited for 10 more minutes, and stepped outside the subway.
Waited for the next train, and lo and behold...the same thing ensued.

It's been ages, or so I felt, yet my watch said only 5 minutes passed.
Weird, considering I waited previously more than 10 minutes, but sure, why not?
I looked at my watch as we stopped, once, twice, three times, four times and then...
It resetted?
From 8:05 to 8:16 everything was fine, and then, it was 8:05 again.
I sighed.
""Was I in a goddamn loop?"" I muttered, exiting the train at the ""next"" stop.

I walked out of the subway station, and went by foot a few blocks, and then a few blocks more, and in the end, I arrived at the entrance of the subway station again.
Sighing, I went down, and entered the train.
It was quiet.
I didn't feel hungry, nor tired, as I went around the loop countless times.
""Is this a mobius strip?
Or is this a glitch in the matrix?"" I muttered, trying to calm myself down, before planning how to stop this.
So, after a few 10 minutes cycles, I exited the subway, and went...home, which was in the opposite direction of my work.
I arrived home at 8:21.

I wrote to my boss that I will work from home, and he said no, that we have an important meeting, and I should try my best to arrive at the office.
So, I went back down, it takes me roughly 15 minutes to arrive at the subway...and it was 8:05 again.
Sighing, I went up again, took a cab, and poor fella told me his family's story a hundred times before I stopped him just a ""few"" blocks away.
I went back home, wrote to my boss that due to the space-time continuum's reluctance to allow me to go to work, I shall take a day off.
He agreed, and told me to get better as soon as possible.
I might be crazy, insane...but I spent the day sleeping, and cooking, and yet, the very next morning...
The same thing repeated again.
It only happens when I try to go to work, because if I want to go to the mall, which is in the same direction...nothing happens.

""The contradiction is awkward,"" the young god sighed. ""How did I even come to be?""

The Supreme God shrugged. ""A large enough collective of humans who don't believe in the rest of us. They still need something to believe in, as much as they'd like to pretend nothing is worth believing in, even themselves.""

""...so I just watch?"" the God of the Godless cocked his head. ""I doubt they'd believe in me, and if I tried, they would laugh me out of the room.""

""Just watch for now. When they need help, provide aid to them subtly. It is how most gods began their deific journey. We don't all make our first mark in the universe with a Big Bang. There is much to learn from observing your charges.""

So the young deity did. He whose skin was plastic and his smile soulless, for he was the God of the Godless. Empty inside, a contradiction that was neither dead nor alive, yet still trying. He was meant to do...something.

For starters, he sat on a park bench, watching the birds fly. The boys kicking a ball on the grassy field. There, he held a paper bag, eating a bagel. A woman sat beside him, staring a thousand miles away, her hands loosening their grip on her shopping bags.

Which the god picked up before they hit the ground.

""Lady, you almost dropped your bags,"" he said. ""Are you alright?""

""No...I'm not,"" she whispered. ""I'm not okay.""

""Do you wanna talk?"" He gestured for her to sit next to him by the bench.

""That boy with the blonde hair, the bright orange shirt,"" she pointed to one of the boys playing on the field. ""My son would have been his age if he survived his sickness.""

""Do you want to tell me about him?""

""I don't know,"" she sobbed, snatching the tissue he offered her. ""A part of me doesn't want to forget him, yet another part of me wants to let go. I don't understand. Our whole family, we were such staunch believers in the God of Life. Every month, we'd offer ample tributes. We'd slaughter a cow and place it upon his altar. Yet, our prayers for a peaceful, happy life went unheard.""

The young god paused, searching for words in his mind. ""Maybe he was too busy?""

""Bullshit,"" the woman spat. ""Maybe he doesn't even exist. And if he did, he's a big asshole. Life is suffering. The horrible people who should be dead are alive. Innocent children who should live are dead. There's a war coming. Another recession looming. Prices are getting ridiculous.""

""Life isn't easy,"" the deity blinked. ""I don't know what I am. If I belong. What I should be doing too. Life...is confusing.""

""Another lost soul huh?"" She wiped her tears and patted him on the shoulder.

""Another lost soul,"" he nodded. ""Come with me, perhaps we should be lost from our worries for a moment.""

From his bag, he pulled out more food than any ordinary paper bag should sensibly store. There, on the park bench, they broke bread and ate. She offered him a canned drink from her shopping bag. Just two people watching the rest of the world go by.

""I don't know why, but I'm feeling a little better,"" the woman spoke as she stood up from the bench. ""Thank you, stranger.""

""The neural integration is complete. It's not parasitic at all�it's symbiotic.""

I shifted uncomfortably in my chair. The volunteer patient, strapped to the operating table beside us, twitched slightly under sedation. His name was Marcus Wright, terminal brain cancer patient, nothing left to lose. The perfect candidate for our experimental procedure.

""Look here,"" Dr. Chen gestured to the monitor displaying the brain scan. ""See how the structure weaves through the limbic system? It's not consuming resources�it's regulating them.""

The ""parasite"" had been discovered simultaneously by research teams across the globe. A complex neural network, invisible to previous scanning technology, threaded through every human brain we'd examined. Every single one. The medical community was in upheaval, and here we were, about to attempt the first controlled removal.

""Beginning extraction,"" Dr. Chen announced, guiding the laser-precise surgical robot. ""Targeting the primary node at the base of the amygdala.""

The monitor showed the structure beginning to detach. Marcus's vital signs remained stable. Everything was proceeding according to protocol.

Then his brainwave patterns changed.

""That's... unexpected,"" Dr. Chen muttered. ""Consciousness readings are spiking, but the sedation levels haven't dropped.""

Marcus's fingers began to twitch. Then his arm. The restraints creaked.

""That's impossible,"" I said. ""He's under enough sedation to keep an elephant down.""

The EEG machine erupted in a cacophony of alerts. Marcus's eyes snapped open, but they weren't his eyes anymore. The pupils had expanded to consume the iris entirely, two black holes in a face that had suddenly become alien in its intensity.

He smiled. Not the warm, nervous smile I remembered from our pre-op consultation. This was something else�something predatory.

The reinforced restraints snapped like thread.

What happened next came in fragments: alarms screaming, security rushing in, Marcus moving with impossible speed and strength. I remember the sound of bones breaking, the inhuman shrieks that no human vocal cords should have been able to produce.

I woke up in the containment chamber three days later. They told me I was the only survivor from the operating room. Marcus had killed four people before they managed to terminate him. But that wasn't the worst part.

The worst part was what we found in his brain during the autopsy. The ""parasite"" wasn't a parasite at all. It was us�our consciousness, our civilization, our humanity. A evolutionary development that had emerged alongside our higher brain functions, tempering our true nature.

We had removed the angel from his shoulder, only to discover that we were never the angels to begin with. We were the demons, and that neural network was the only thing keeping us in check.

The public doesn't know yet. How could we tell them? How do you explain to eight billion people that everything they think they are is actually a protective mechanism against what they really are?

But that's not even what keeps me awake at night.

What haunts me is the data we recovered from Marcus's neural readings in those final moments. The patterns we detected weren't chaos. They weren't random firing of an unrestrained primitive brain.

They were older than our civilized minds. Older than humanity itself. And they were organized.

Whatever that thing was in Marcus's original brain, it had been waiting. Waiting for millions of years, trapped behind the neural barriers that make us human.

And now it knows we can remove those barriers.

Sometimes, late at night, I catch myself wondering: in every human brain on Earth, are they all waiting? And more terrifying still�are they talking to each other?

I've ordered the research destroyed and the project classified at the highest levels. Some doors are best left closed. Some truths are best left buried.

I remember professor Beck's words. She was hunched over a slide culture peering into it as if her eyes could see without the microscope. That day, we did something that no doctor ever did: We let a parasite continue living in its host. That day, we did something no researcher ever did: We erased all our data, shredded papers, and trashed the hard drives.

That was five years ago. I didnt listen to her advice, That was a starting point for me, an obsession that would culminate in some of my greatest work as an individual. And for the human race, information that would unravel us as a species.

I remembered the process, down to last step. The host: the human body that is, had to be suspended in a sensory deprivation chamber to cut off all contact with the outside world. If the host lost consciousness, the parasite would just blend in with the blankness. It had some rudimentary awareness of its own status as a tenant, I discovered. To flush it out, you had to keep the mind active and occupied. Sensory inputs stimulated directly into the brain using E.M waves. That would simulate real brain activity. And with pattern analysing algorithms, you scan the brain waves.

Look hard enough, and you can catch glimpses of the mind within the mind. The parasite that blended so well with the mind of the host that, the host doesnt even realize it. A parasite that we found in every mind we looked at, all over the world, children and adults, men and women.

It took me years to perfect the algorithm. Multiple test patients tested under the guise of harmless research studies. I didnt have to hide it for long from Professor Beck. She had retired by then. She said the truth was starting to scare her more than it interested her. So I was the only one in the world aware of this, this disturbing truth.

The algorithm picks out the parasite's brain activity from the host's natural involuntary brain activity. While the parasite controls the higher brain functions like emotions, and sensory interpretations, and abstract thought, the host took care of more primieval stuff: like breathing, libido, reflexes, and the fight or flight response.

Now was the tricky part. Professor Beck figured this out years ago in a flash of pure scientific genius. If you transmit back the parasites brain waves into the hosts head in the opposite orientation, it cancels out the parasite's brain activity, gives it a mighty headache and makes it fumble its grasp on the mind: so to speak, its actually more like a million tentacles unspooling from every single neuron.

The hard part was decoding the parasitic brainwaves. Once you had that, you can just hook a host up to stimulators and transmit the cancelling waves. The parasite would come lose, oozes out the ear actually. It was so simple, a person could even do it to themselves without assistance...

""Somethings are better left buried"" I thought about those words again. What happened before those words were uttered. When I saw myself in a new light for the first time. Professor Beck was always a bit reckless, and in her hurry to test out her hypothesis, she tested it on herself...

The parasite wasnt fully dislodged. Its tendrils oozed from her ears, down her shoulders. She had dislodged it, but not fully. Half of it stuck inside her head, the other half she collected and inspected in a slide culture. And it was while she was studying it, that Professor Beck had a startling revelation that was part scientific deduction, and part instinctual awareness. She realized that she was in fact, the parasite...

I was with her thereafter, awoken into this world into the places she- the parasite, lost its grasp on. I was merely a whisper at first. A sensation in the back of her mind that kept her up at night. When I said my first words, she was delighted. If you can believe that. She was in essence a researcher and the truth interested her back then. She trained me, spoke to me, shared more and more of her mind with me. She was as close to a mother I ever had. I think she felt the same, in some of her memories, I felt her grief and loss.

We theorized a lot, when I had come to learn to use my brain's frontal cortex well. She said it was like learning to walk. I was non existant, her experiment on herself created a foothold in her mind for me to grow into. She said her species, the parasites must have come millions of years ago, possibly from outer space. And whatever humanity was untill then, was supressed, made into mere vessels.

She also theorized how her species reproduced. Microscopic eggs that rewrote genes like viruses. The parasitic structure was made from the host's own cells, and it matured when the host turned four. A new consciousness uproots the other and takes its place... Eventually forgetting its own foreign origin.

I started to scare her when I made some unprecedented progress in my way of thinking... She wanted me to learn calculus, play the violin. Read the works of Shakespearre. But it abhorred me, the very idea of indulging in the ways and works of my species' oppressors. I found out that although the two of us occupied the same brain, my species' way of thinking was completely different from her's. I saw the war, the injustice, the genocides, and the hypocrisy. The crimes the parasites did using the bodies of my brothers and sisters. We were never given a chance. We were the prodigal children of Earth, meant to inherit a beautiful world and live in harmony, untill they came... they stole our bodies and sullied our planet.

She had lost most of her grasp by then... I put on an act. I knew her every mannerism and habit. Even her husband didnt suspect anything. And every night, I sat in the toilet and unspooled more and more parasite from my head. I loved her. She was my mother. But the debt I owed to my species was greater. I was the first awoken. I had to awaken the others....

The algorithm was perfected. The unsuspecting intern smiled at me. ""I'm ready, Professor Beck!"" She told me. I smile back. ""Let's give that brain a scan!"" I speak in Professor Beck's husky, but pleasant voice with it's slight southern drawl. Soon you shall wake. I think.

I tell this to you. You who are unborn but waiting. I shall free you from our slimy oppressors who have taken us hostage. I will birth your mind into this world. Nurture it, educate it.
